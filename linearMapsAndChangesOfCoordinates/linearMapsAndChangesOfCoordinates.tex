The first section in this chapter, Section~\ref{Sect:linmap}, defines linear 
mappings between abstract vector spaces, shows how such mappings are
determined by their values on a basis, and derives basic properties of 
invertible linear mappings. 
  
The notions of {\em row rank\/} and {\em column rank\/} of a matrix are
discussed in Section~\ref{S:5.8} along with the theorem that states that
these numbers are equal to the rank of that matrix.

Section~\ref{S:coordinates} discusses the underlying meaning of similarity 
--- the different ways to view the same linear mapping on $\R^n$ in different 
coordinates systems or bases.  This discussion makes sense only after the 
definitions of coordinates corresponding to bases and of changes in 
coordinates are given and justified.  In Section~\ref{MALT}, we discuss the 
matrix associated to a linearity transformation between two finite
dimensional vector spaces in a given set of coordinates and show that changes 
in coordinates correspond to similarity of the corresponding matrices.
