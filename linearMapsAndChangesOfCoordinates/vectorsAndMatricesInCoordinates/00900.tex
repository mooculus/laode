\begin{computerExercise} \label{c7.3.4}
Find a basis ${\cal W}=\{w_1,w_2\}$ such that $[L_A]_{\cal W}$ is
a diagonal matrix, where $L_A$ is the linear map associated with the
matrix
\[
A = \mattwo{-10}{-6}{18}{11}.
\]

\begin{solution}

\ans The matrix $[L]_{\cal W}$ is diagonal in the basis:
\[
{\cal W} = \left\{\vectwo{1}{2},\vectwo{2}{3}\right\}
\]

\soln Theorem~\ref{T:putinform2} states
that the matrix $[L]_{\cal W}$ is diagonal if ${\cal W}$ consists of
eigenvectors of $L$ corresponding to real eigenvalues.  By
computation, we find that $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$ are
the eigenvalues of $L$.  We then find that $Lw_1 = 2w_1$ when
$w_1 = (1,2)^t$ and $Lw_2 = -w_2$ when $w_2 = (2,3)^t$, so $w_1$ and
$w_2$ are the eigenvectors of $L$.
