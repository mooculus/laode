Verify that ${\cal V}= \{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ where
\[
p_1(t)=1+2t, \quad p_2(t)=t+2t^2, \AND p_3(t)=2-t^2,
\]
is a basis for the vector space of polynomials ${\cal P}_2$.
Let $p(t)=t$ and find $[p]_{\cal V}$.

\begin{solution}

\ans If $p(t) = t$, then
$[p]_{\cal V} = (\frac{4}{7}, -\frac{1}{7}, -\frac{2}{7})$.

%\soln In order to verify that ${\cal V}$ is a basis for ${\cal P}_2$, first
%show that the set $\{1,t,t^2\}$ is a basis for ${\cal P}_2$.  To prove
%this, note that any polynomial in ${\cal P}_2$ can be written as
%$p = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2t + \alpha_3t^2$, so the set spans ${\cal P}_2$.
%Also, $0 = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2t + \alpha_3t^2$ if and only if
%$\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = 0$, so the set is linearly
%independent.

\soln The set $\{1,t,t^2\}$ is a basis for ${\cal P}_2$, which therefore has dimension 3. 
Thus, any linearly independent set of three vectors
in ${\cal P}_2$ will span ${\cal P}_2$.  So we need only show that
${\cal V}$ is a linearly independent set, which we do by solving:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
0 & = & \alpha_1p_1(t) + \alpha_2p_2(t) + \alpha_3p_3(t) \\
& = & \alpha_1(1 + 2t) + \alpha_2(t + 2t^2) + \alpha_3(2 - t^2) \\
& = & (\alpha_1 + 2\alpha_3) + (2\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)t +
(2\alpha_2 - \alpha_3)t^2. \end{array}
\]
This equation is identically $0$ if
\[
\matthree{1}{0}{2}{2}{1}{0}{0}{2}{-1}\vecthree{\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}
{\alpha_3} = 0.
\]
The only solution to this system is $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3
 = 0$, so the elements are linearly independent and ${\cal V}$ is
a basis for ${\cal P}_2$.

\para Let $p(t) = t$.  Then find this vector $[p]_{\cal V}$ by solving
$p(t) = \alpha_1p_1(t) + \alpha_2p_2(t) + \alpha_3p_3(t)$. 
That is,
\[ \vecthree{0}{1}{0} = \matthree{1}{0}{2}{2}{1}{0}{0}{2}{-1}
\vecthree{\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}{\alpha_3}. \]
Solve by substitution to obtain $\alpha_1 = \frac{4}{7}$, $\alpha_2
= -\frac{1}{7}$, and $\alpha_3 = -\frac{2}{7}$.
