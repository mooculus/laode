Let $\C$ denote the set of complex numbers.  Verify that
$\C$ is a two-dimensional vector space.  Show that $L:\C\to\C$
defined by
\[
L(z) = \lambda z,
\]
where $\lambda=\sigma+i\tau$ is a linear mapping.

\begin{solution}

\soln
The space $\C$ is a two dimensional real vector space since every
element of $\C$ can be written as $c = \sigma + \tau i$, a linear
combination of the linearly independent two dimensional set $\{1,i\}$.

\para Let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be elements of $\R$.  Then,
\[ L(z_1 + z_2) = \lambda(z_1 + z_2) =
\lambda z_1 + \lambda z_2 = L(z_1) + L(z_2). \]
For any real scalar $c$,
\[ L(cz_1) = \lambda(cz_1) = 
c\lambda z_1 = cL(z_1). \]
Therefore, $L(z) = \lambda z$ is a linear mapping.
