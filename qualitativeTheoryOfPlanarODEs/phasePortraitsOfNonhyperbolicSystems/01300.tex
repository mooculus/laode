\begin{exercise} \label{c6.9.5}
Consider the system of differential equations $\dot{X}=CX$ where
$C=\mattwo{2}{-4}{1}{-2}$.  By hand show that this system is a shear and
use {\pplane} to determine its phase portrait.  Describe both the
similarities and the differences of the phase portrait of this system
and the phase portrait of \eqref{e:00}.

\begin{solution}

By definition, a system $\dot{X} = CX$ is a shear if the system has two
zero eigenvalues.  In this case, $\det(C) = 0$ and $\trace(C) = 0$, so
the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0$.  The phase portrait of
this system is shown in Figure~\ref{c6.9.5}a, and the phase portrait of
\eqref{e:00} is shown in Figure~\ref{c6.9.5}b.  In both phase portraits,
all trajectories are straight lines parallel to the eigenvector.  However,
in \ref{c6.9.5}b, the trajectories are parallel to the $x$-axis, whereas
in \ref{c6.9.5}a, they are not.
