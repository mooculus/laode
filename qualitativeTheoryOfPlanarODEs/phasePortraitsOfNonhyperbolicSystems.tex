 \label{S:6.9}

A linear constant coefficient system $\dot{X}=CX$ is not hyperbolic
\index{nonhyperbolic}
when either $C$ has a zero eigenvalue ($\det(C)=0$) or when $C$ has
purely imaginary eigenvalues ($\det(C)>0$ and $\trace(C)=0$).  These
special cases are indicated by bold lines in Figure~\ref{F:td}.

There are four types of nonhyperbolic planar systems.  There are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	the {\em center}\index{center} --- nonzero purely imaginary
eigenvalues,
\item	the {\em saddle-node\/}\index{saddle-node} --- a single
zero eigenvalue,
\item	the {\em shear\/}\index{shear} --- a double zero eigenvalue;
one  independent eigenvector, and
\item	the zero matrix itself.
\end{enumerate}
The dynamics in the last case are very easy to describe --- all solutions
are equilibria and solutions remain at the initial point for all time.

\subsubsection*{Centers}

There is a new kind of solution that occurs only in centers --- the time
periodic solution\index{periodic solution} --- as we now explain.
In Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar},
Theorem~\ref{T:putinform} we showed that when the $2\times 2$
matrix $C$ has purely eigenvalues $\pm i\tau$ with $\tau\neq 0$, then $C$
is similar to the matrix
\[
B =   \mattwo{0}{-\tau}{\tau}{0}.
\]
In Table~\ref{T:3sys}(b) we showed that solutions to $\dot{X}=BX$ are
\[
X(t) = \mattwo{\cos(\tau t)}{-\sin(\tau t)}{\sin(\tau t)}{\cos(\tau t)}X_0
=R_{\tau t}X_0,
\]
where $X_0$ is the vector of initial conditions and $R_{\tau t}$ is a
rotation matrix (recall \eqref{e:rotmat} of Chapter~\ref{chap:matrices}).

Note that every solution to $\dot{X}=BX$ traverses a circle around the
origin as $R_{\tau t}$ rotates the plane counterclockwise through the angle
$\tau t$.  As an example, we graph\index{phase!portrait!for a center}
a solution to $\dot{X}=BX$ and its time
series in Figure~\ref{F:center} when $\tau=3$.  All centers have nonzero
trajectories that are either ellipses\index{ellipse} or circles, and
those centers that do
not have the form of $B$ typically produce ellipses as solutions.  See
Exercise~\ref{E:notcircles}.

     \caption{(Left) Solutions to $\dot{X}=BX$ for $\tau=3$.
	(Right) Time series of a solution illustrating time periodicity.}
     \label{F:center}
\end{figure*}

It is instructive to see how solutions change when the real part of the
eigenvalue traverses through zero.  Suppose that $C$ has eigenvalues
$\sigma\pm i\tau$ and is in normal form
\[
C = \mattwo{\sigma}{-\tau}{\tau}{\sigma}.
\]
We illustrate this change by graphing the time series (of both $x$ and $y$
versus $t$) in Figure~\ref{F:spiraling} with $\tau=3$ and $\sigma=-1,0,1$,
respectively. Note that when $\sigma<0$ the time series oscillate about zero
but also damp down to zero, while when $\sigma>0$ the time series oscillate
and diverge.  When $\sigma = 0$, there is an exact balance leading to time
periodic solutions.

     \caption{Solutions of $\dot{X}=BX$ for $\tau=3$ and $\sigma=-1,0,1$.}
     \label{F:spiraling}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Saddle Nodes}

When the determinant of a matrix $C$ is zero, then $C$ must have a zero
eigenvalue.  The simplest way for $\det(C)$ to be zero is for $C$ to have a
single zero eigenvalue.  In this case we call the origin a {\em saddle node}.

So the eigenvalues of a saddle node are $\lambda_1=0$ and $\lambda_2\neq 0$.
For simplicity of discussion, we assume that $\lambda_2<0$.  Let $v_1$ and
$v_2$ be the associated eigenvectors.  Since $Cv_1=0$, it follows that saddle
nodes have a line of equilibria\index{line of equilibria}
$X(t)=\alpha_1v_1$ for every scalar $\alpha_1$.

There is also a solution $X(t)=e^{\lambda_2 t}v_2$ that converges to the
origin in forward time (since $\lambda_2<0$).  The general solution to this
system is
\[
X(t) = \alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 e^{\lambda_2 t}v_2,
\]
for scalars $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.  Since $\lambda_2<0$ this solution
converges on the equilibrium $\alpha_1 v_1$ in forward time.  Moreover,
the trajectory for any solution stays for all time on the line parallel
to the vector $v_2$.  The phase portrait\index{phase!portrait!for a saddle
node}
for the system
\begin{equation}  \label{e:10ev}
\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{-2}{4}{1}{-2} X
\end{equation}
is shown in Figure~\ref{F:10ev} (left) along with the time series
of a solution (right).  Note how the time series (of $x$ versus $t$)
asymptotes onto the $x$ coordinate of an equilibrium.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
     \centerline{%
     \psfig{file=../figures/z1ev.eps,width=2.2in}
     \psfig{file=../figures/z1evts.eps,width=2.2in}}
     \caption{(Left) Phase portrait of \protect\eqref{e:10ev}.
	(Right) Time series of a solution.}
     \label{F:10ev}
\end{figure*}

The saddle-node\index{saddle-node} is a
nonhyperbolic equilibrium\index{equilibrium!nonhyperbolic}
that sits between
the hyperbolic saddle and the hyperbolic node (either the nodal
sink or the nodal source), just as the center\index{center} sits
between the hyperbolic spiral source and the hyperbolic spiral sink.  To
illustrate this point we show three time series in
Figure~\ref{F:saddlenodebif} for the system
\begin{equation}  \label{e:saddlenodebif}
\frac{dX}{dt}  =  \mattwo{\mu}{0}{0}{-1}X
\end{equation}
when $\mu<0$, $\mu=0$, and $\mu>0$.  See how the $y$ time series
decays exponentially to zero in forward time in each case.  But
the $x$ time series converges to zero when $\mu<0$ and grows
exponentially when $\mu>0$.  Finally, when $\mu=0$ the $x$ time
series is constant.

     \psfig{file=../figures/sn0.eps,width=2.2in}
     \psfig{file=../figures/snp1.eps,width=2.2in}}
     \caption{Time series for solutions of \protect\eqref{e:saddlenodebif}
	when $\mu=-0.2,0,0.2$.}
     \label{F:saddlenodebif}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection*{Shears}
\index{shear}

The last example of a nonhyperbolic system occurs when the matrix $C$
has two zero eigenvalues --- but only one linearly independent
eigenvector.  In this case we call the origin a {\em shear\/}.  After a
similarity transformation such a system is
\begin{equation}  \label{e:00}
\frac{dX}{dt} = \mattwo{0}{1}{0}{0} X
\end{equation}
The solution is
\[
(x(t),y(t)) = (x_0+y_0t,y_0).
\]
Thus solutions move along lines parallel to the $x$ axis through
the point $(x_0,y_0)$ with speed $y_0$.  These trajectories move
to the right when $y_0>0$ and to the left when $y_0<0$.
