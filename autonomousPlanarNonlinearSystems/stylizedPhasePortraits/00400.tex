\begin{computerExercise} \label{c8.4.3}
Use {\pplane} to determine the number of equilibria and their types, the
number of limit cycles, and the connecting trajectories for the system
\begin{matlabEquation}\label{MATLAB:3}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & 2-y^2-((x^2-2)^2+(y^2-2)^2-1)(x^2-2)-0.2x  \\
\dot{y} & = & x^2-2-((x^2-2)^2+(y^2-2)^2-1)(y^2-2)
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
in the square $-3 \leq x,y \leq 3$.   
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Draw a qualitative phase portrait for this system.  
\item[(b)] Characterize all solutions to this differential equation that 
stay within the square $-3 \leq x,y \leq 3$ for all forward and backward time 
$t$.
\item[(c)] Draw the time series in $x$ versus $t$ for the trajectory whose
initial condition is $(0,0)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

The equilibria and their types are:
\begin{verbatim}
(1.4650, 1.3590)        Spiral source.           
(-1.3651, -1.4635)      Spiral sink.             
(1.4650, -1.3590)       Saddle point.            
(-1.3651, 1.4635)       Saddle point. 
\end{verbatim}
There are two limit cycles: one surrounding the spiral source at
$(1.4650, 1.3590)$ and one surrounding the spiral sink at $(-1.3651, -1.4635)$.

(a) A graph of the system is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.3}a.

(b) The four equilibria surround a roughly rectangular region.  As shown
by the connecting trajectories in the graph, all trajectories with
initial points inside this region remain in this region.  Note that this
includes trajectories with initial conditions inside the limit cycles.
All trajectories outside this region leave the window
$-3 \leq x,y \leq 3$ in forward or backward time.

(c) The {\pplane} time series for the solution starting at $(0,0)$ is
shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.3}b.
