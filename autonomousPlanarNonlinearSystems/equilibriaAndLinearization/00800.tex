\begin{exercise} \label{c8.2.7}
Consider the system of differential equations \eqref{e:global2exam}
that depends on the constant $a$.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]	Find the equilibria of this system.
\item[(b)]	Find the Jacobian matrices at the equilibria.  
\item[(c)]	For which values of $a$ are the equilibria not
		hyperbolic?
\item[(d)]	For those values of $a$ where the equilibria are 
		hyperbolic, determine whether or not these equilibria 
		are asymptotically stable.
\item[(e)]	For each nonhyperbolic equilibrium, write the linearized 
		system and draw its phase plane.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) Solving system \eqref{e:global2exam} for $\dot{x} = \dot{y} = 0$
yields equilibria at $(0,0)$, $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$, and $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$.

(b) The general Jacobian matrix for \eqref{e:global2exam} is
\[
(dJ)_{(x,y)} = \cmattwo{0}{1}{2.2 - 3x^2 + ay}{2.1 + ax}.
\]
The Jacobian matrices at the equilibria are:
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
(dJ)_{(0,0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{2.2}{2.1} \\
(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{2.1 + \sqrt{2.2}a} \\
(dJ)_{(-\sqrt{2.2},0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{2.1 - \sqrt{2.2}a}. \\
\end{array}
\]

(c) \ans The Jacobian of the equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is not
hyperbolic at $a = -2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$, and the Jacobian of the
equilibrium at $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is not hyperbolic at
$a = 2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$.

\soln Note that a matrix is nonhyperbolic if the determinant is positive
and the trace is zero.

(d) \ans The equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is asymptotically stable for
$a < -2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$ and the equilibrium at
$(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is asymptotically stable for
$a > 2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$.  Thus, there is no value of $a$ for which
both equilibria are stable.  The equilibrium at $(0,0)$ is not stable,
since the eigenvalues of the Jacobian have opposite sign.

\soln Note that the determinant of the Jacobian is always positive, so
the equilibria are stable for values of $a$ at which the trace is negative.

(e) For $a = -2.1/\sqrt{2.2}$, the equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$
is non-hyperbolic, with Jacobian matrix
\[
(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)} = \mattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{0}.
\]
The linear system $\dot{X} = (dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)}X$ is pictured in
Figure~\ref{c8.2.7}.  Note that the system is a center.  For
$a = 2.1/\sqrt{2.2}$, the equilibrium at $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is
nonhyperbolic.  Its Jacobian at this point is identical to
$(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)}$.
