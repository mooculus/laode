\begin{exercise} \label{c8.2.5}
Consider the planar nonlinear system of ODEs
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dx}{dt} & = & 1 - x - y \\
\frac{dy}{dt} & = & 2xy. 
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find all equilibria of this system.
\item[(b)] Determine the behavior of trajectories in a small
neighborhood of each equilibrium.
\item[(c)] Sketch the phase portrait of this system.  {\bf Hint}: Check
for invariant axes.
\item[(d)] Use {\pplane} to verify your sketch.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans The equilibria occur at $(x,y) = (1,0)$ and $(x,y) = (0,1)$.

\soln Solve $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.

(b) \ans The point $(x,y) = (1,0)$ is a saddle.  The point $(x,y) = (0,1)$
is a spiral sink.

\soln Let $f(x,y) = 1 - x - y$, $g(x,y) = 2xy$,
and $F = (f,g)$.  Then the Jacobian matrix is
\[
(dF)_{(x,y)} = \mattwo{f_x(x,y)}{f_y(x,y)}{g_x(x,y)}{g_y(x,y)}
= \mattwo{-1}{-1}{2y}{2x}.
\]
Specifically, at the equilibrium points:
\[
(dF)_{(1,0)} = \mattwo{-1}{-1}{0}{2} \qquad
(dF)_{(0,1)} = \mattwo{-1}{-1}{2}{0}.
\]
The eigenvalues of $(dF)_{(1,0)}$ are $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$;
so the point is like a saddle in a small neighborhood.  The trace of
$(dF)_{(0,1)}$ is $-1 < 0$ and the determinant is $2 > 0$, so the
discriminant is negative and, within a small neighborhood, the point
is like a spiral sink.

(c) Compute the eigenvectors of the Jacobian of the saddle point $(1,0)$.
The invariant axes of $(1,0)$ are the eigendirections $(1,-3)$ and
$(1,0)$.  Use these vectors to graph the system.  Your sketch should
resemble the {\pplane} graph in Figure~\ref{c8.2.5}.
