Verify that the system of differential equations
\begin{matlabEquation} \label{8.3.2eq} 
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & x-2y -(x^2+y^2)x + 0.1x^2\\
\dot{y} & = & 2x+y - (x^2+y^2)y - 0.2(y^2-x^2)
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
has a single limit cycle.  Compare the phase portrait of this
equation with that of \eqref{e:nonlincenter2}.

\begin{solution}

Figure~\ref{c8.3.2} shows the {\pplane} graph of \eqref{8.3.2eq}.
The system has a single equilibrium at the origin, so all limit cycles
must surround the origin.  We can verify visually that the system has
one limit cycle at $r = 1$.  The graph of this system is similar to
the graph of \eqref{e:nonlincenter2}, since both
have single equilibria at the origin and single stable limit cycles at
$r = 1$.
