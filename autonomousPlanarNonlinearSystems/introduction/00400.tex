\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c8.1.3a} -- \ref{c8.1.3c} use {\pplane}
to find a solution to \eqref{e:global2exam} (with $a=1.6$) satisfying the 
given properties. Plot the time series of $y$ versus $t$ for that solution 
and describe the differences in the three time series.
\begin{exercise} \label{c8.1.3a}
Find a solution that limits on the periodic solution in backwards time and 
goes to infinity in the first quadrant in forward time.

\begin{solution}

One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (1,4)$.  The {\tt y vs.\ t}
time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3a}.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c8.1.3b}
Find a solution that limits on a spiral sink in forward time and on a periodic 
solution in backwards time.

\begin{solution}

One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (-1,0)$.  The {\tt y vs.\ t}
time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3b}.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c8.1.3c}
Find a solution that limits on a node in backward time and goes to infinity 
in the first quadrant in forward time.

\begin{solution}
One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (1,2)$.  The
{\tt y vs.\ t} time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3c}.

\para The trajectories in Exercises~\ref{c8.1.3a} and \ref{c8.1.3b} are
similar in backward time, since they limit on similar periodic
solutions as $t \rightarrow -\infty$.  Additionally, the trajectories
in \ref{c8.1.3a} and \ref{c8.1.3c} are similar in forward time, since
both approach infinity in the first quadrant.  In forward time,
\ref{c8.1.3b} approaches $y = 0$, and in backward time, \ref{c8.1.3c}
approaches $y = 0$.
