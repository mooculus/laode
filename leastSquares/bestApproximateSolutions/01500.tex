\begin{computerExercise}\label{YZ_9.1.15}
Consider the system of 4 linear equations in 3 unknown
\[
Ax=b
\]
where 
\[
A=\Matrix{7&4&-3\\0&9&-10\\3&-2&-5\\9&2&1} \AND b=\Matrix{4\\0\\3\\1}.
\] 
Use \Matlab to verify that the system is inconsistent and to find a least squares approximation solution of the system.
\begin{solution}

\ans  $\tilde{x}=\Matrix{0.3534\\-0.2913\\-0.3161}$ is a least squares approximation solution of the system.

\soln Use the command {\tt rref([A b])} to find the reduced echelon form of the concatenated matrix $[A|b]$:
\begin{verbatim}
ans =

     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0     0     1
\end{verbatim}
So the system is inconsistent. This also shows that the column vectors of $A$ is linearly independent, so we use the command {\tt inv(A'*A)*A'*b} to find the least squares approximation of $Ax = b$:

\begin{verbatim}
ans =

    0.3534
   -0.2913
   -0.3161
\end{verbatim}
It follows that $\tilde{x} = \Matrix{0.3534\\-0.2913\\-0.3161}$ is a least squares approximation solution of the system.
\end{solution}
