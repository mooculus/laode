\begin{computerExercise} \label{c7.6.1}
World population data for each decade of this century (except for 1910)
is given in Table~\ref{T:popdata}.  Assume that population growth is linear
$P=mT+b$ where time $T$ is measured in decades since the year 1900 and $P$ is
measured in billions of people.  This data can be recovered by typing
{\tt e9\_3\_po}.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Find $m$ and $b$ to give the best linear fit to this data.
\item[(b)]  Use this linear approximation to the data to make predictions
of the world populations in the year 1910 and 2000.
\end{itemize}
\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c||c|c|}
\hline
Year & Population (in millions) & Year & Population (in millions)\\
\hline
1900 & 1625 & 1950 & 2516  \\
1910 & n.a. & 1960 & 3020 \\
1920 & 1813 & 1970 & 3698 \\
1930 & 1987 & 1980 & 4448 \\

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans The best linear fit to the data is obtained with $m \approx
0.4084$ and $b \approx 0.9603$, where $m$ and $b$ are measured in
billions.

\soln Create the matrix $A$ whose columns are $w_1$ and $w_2$.  Then use
\eqref{E:nearestvector} to compute the best values for $m$ and $b$.

(b) \ans In 1910, $P \approx 408.4(1) + 960.3 = 1369$ million people.

\para In 2000, $P \approx 408.4(10) + 960.3 = 5044$ million people.


\soln As shown in Figure~\ref{c7.6.1}, a linear approximation does not
fit the data points well.  To understand why, assume that population
change is governed by the differential equation:
\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = rP
\]
where $r$ is constant.  Then $\frac{d^2P}{dT^2} = r^2P > 0$.
Then the population curve is concave up, and a linear approximation
underestimates the population at the endpoints of the curve.

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c7.6.1C}
Continue from Exercise~\ref{c7.6.1}.
Do you expect the prediction for the year 2000 to be high or low
or on target? Explain why by graphing the data with the best linear fit
superimposed and by using the differential equation population model
discussed in Section~\ref{S:growthmodels}.

\begin{solution}
\ans The prediction for 2000 is likely to be low.
