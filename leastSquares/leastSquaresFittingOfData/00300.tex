\begin{computerExercise} \label{c7.6.2}
Find the best sinusoidal approximation to the monthly average low temperatures
in Paris and Rio de Janeiro.  How does the variation of these temperatures
about the mean compare to the high temperature calculations? 
Recall that by typing {\sf temper} in the \Matlab  command window, the temperatures 
and the vectors {\sf T}, {\sf F1}, {\sf F2} and {\sf F3} are entered into \Matlabp.

\begin{solution}

\ans A good sinusoidal approximation for the low temperatures in Paris
is 
\[ \hbox{temp}(t) = 51.4167 - 9.4908\cos(\frac{2\pi t}{12}) -
8.4745\sin(\frac{2\pi t}{12}). \]
An approximation for the low temperatures in Rio is
\[ \hbox{temp}(t) = 67.8333 + 3.3987\cos(\frac{2\pi t}{12}) +
3.5654\sin(\frac{2\pi t}{12}). \]

\soln Use a set of \Matlab commands similar to those shown in
Section~\ref{S:7.6} to graph the low temperatures in Paris
(Figure~\ref{c7.6.2}a) and Rio (Figure~\ref{c7.6.2}b).  The
variations about the mean temperature are $d_P = 12.7237$ and
$d_R = 4.9258$.  (These values can be computed for each set of data
by typing {\tt d = sqrt(b(2)\^{}2 + b(3)\^{}2)} in \Matlabp.) 
The low temperatures in Paris vary more depending on the time of
year than do the temperatures in Rio, which is consistent with
the graphs and with the values of $d$ for the high temperatures.
