\begin{computerExercise} \label{c4.4.5}
Use \Matlab to verify that solutions to the system of linear differential
equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dx}{dt} & = & 2x + y\\
\frac{dy}{dt} & = & y
\end{eqnarray*}
are linear combinations of the two solutions
\[
U(t) = e^{2t}\vectwo{1}{0} \AND V(t) = e^{t}\vectwo{-1}{1}.
\]
More concretely, proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  By superposition, the general solution to the differential
equation has the form $X(t)=\alpha U(t) + \beta V(t)$.  Find constants
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha U(0) + \beta V(0) = \vectwo{0}{1}$.
\item[(b)] Graph the second component $y(t)$ of this solution using the
\Matlab {\tt plot} command.
\item[(c)] Use {\pplane} to compute a solution via the {\sf Keyboard
input} starting at $(x(0),y(0)) = (0,1)$ and then use the
{\tt y} {\tt vs} {\tt t} command in {\pplane} to graph this solution.
\item[(d)] Compare the results of the two plots.
\item[(e)]  Repeat steps (a)--(d) using the initial vector $\vectwo{1}{1}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) \ans If $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = 1$, then
\[
\alpha U(0) + \beta V(0) = \vectwo{0}{1}. 
\]

\soln Solve the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrl}
\alpha & - & \beta & = & 0 \\
& & \beta & = & 1. \end{array}
\]

(b) Figure~\ref{c4.4.5}a shows $y$ as a function of $t$.  The figure
was created by the \Matlab commands:
\begin{verbatim}
t = linspace(-8,2);
y = exp(t);
plot(t,y)
\end{verbatim}

(c) Figure~\ref{c4.4.5}b shows the {\pplane} graph of the system,
and Figure~\ref{c4.4.5}c shows the {\tt y vs.\ t} graph.

(d) The two plots are identical, since the {\pplane} command
{\tt y vs.\ t} graphs the $y$ component of the solution, which is
precisely what we did by hand in (b).

(e) In this case, $\alpha = 2$ and $\beta = 1$.  Since the $y$
component of $U(t)$ is zero, the graphs of $y(t)$ are identical
to those in (b) and (c).
