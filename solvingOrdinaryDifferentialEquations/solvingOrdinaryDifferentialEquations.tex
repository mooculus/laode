The study of linear systems of equations given in Chapter~\ref{lineq}
provides one motivation for the study of matrices and linear algebra.  
Linear constant coefficient systems of ordinary differential equations 
provide a second motivation for this study.  In this chapter we
show how the phase space geometry of systems of differential equations
motivates the idea of {\em eigendirections} (or invariant directions) and
{\em eigenvalues\/} (or growth rates).  

We begin this chapter with a discussion of the theory and application
of the simplest of linear differential equations, the linear growth equation,
$\dot{x}=\lambda x$.  In Section~\ref{S:singlelineareqn}, we solve the linear
growth equation and discuss the fact that solutions to differential equations
are functions; and we emphasize this point by using \Matlab to graph
solutions of $x$ as a function of $t$.  In the optional Section~\ref{S:growthmodels} we  
illustrate the applicability of this very simple equation with a discussion of 
compound interest and a simple population model.


The next two sections introduce planar constant coefficient linear
differential equations.  In these sections we use the program {\pplane}
(written by John Polking\index{Polking, John} and updated by 
Roy Goodman)\index{Goodman, Roy} that solves numerically planar systems of
differential equations.  In Section~\ref{sec:UncoupledLS} we discuss 
uncoupled systems --- two independent one dimensional systems like those 
presented in Section~\ref{S:singlelineareqn} --- whose solution geometry in the 
plane is somewhat more complicated than might be expected.  In 
Section~\ref{s:3.5} we discuss coupled linear systems.  Here we
illustrate the existence and nonexistence of eigendirections.

In Section~\ref{S:IVP&E} we show how initial value problems can be solved 
by building the solution --- through the use of superposition as discussed in 
Section~\ref{S:Superposition} --- from simpler solutions.  These simpler
solutions are ones generated from real eigenvalues and eigenvectors
--- when they exist.  In Section~\ref{S:evchp} we develop the theory of  
{\em eigenvalues\/} and {\em characteristic polynomials\/} of $2\times 2$ 
matrices.  (The corresponding theory for $n\times n$ matrices is developed in 
Chapter~\ref{C:D&E}.)

The method for solving planar constant coefficient linear differential 
equations with real eigenvalues is summarized in Section~\ref{S:IVPR}.  This 
method is based on the material of Sections~\ref{S:IVP&E} and \ref{S:evchp}.  
The complete discussion of the solutions of linear planar systems of 
differential equations is given in Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar}.  This discussion 
is best done after we have introduced the linear algebra concepts of vector 
subspaces and bases in Chapter~\ref{C:vectorspaces}.

The chapter ends with an optional discussion of {\em Markov chains\/} in 
Section~\ref{S:TransitionApplied}.  Markov chains give a method for 
analyzing branch processes where at each time unit several outcomes are 
possible, each with a given probability.
