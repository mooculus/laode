\begin{exercise} \label{c3.4.5}
Suppose that $a$ and $d$ are both negative, so that the origin
is asymptotically stable.  Make several choices of $a<d<0$ and
observe that solution trajectories tend to approach the origin
tangent to one of the axes.  Determine which one.  Try to prove
that your experimental guess is always correct?

\begin{solution}

\ans Trajectories approach the origin tangent to the $y$-axis if
$A < D < 0$. 

\soln We can prove this fact by showing that, as $t \rightarrow \infty$,
the tangent direction of the trajectory limits on the $y$-axis.  The
tangent vector of the trajectory $(x(t),y(t))$ at any point is:
\[ \left(\frac{dx}{dt}(t), \frac{dy}{dt}(t)\right) = \left(Ax(t),
Dy(t)\right) = \left(Ax_0e^{At}, Dy_0e^{Dt}\right) =
e^{Dt}\left(Ax_0e^{(A - D)t}, Dy_0\right) \]
The value of $e^{Dt}$ is relevant only to the length of the
tangent and does not affect the direction.  As $t$ approaches
infinity, $e^{(A - D)t}$ approaches $0$, since $A - D < 0$.
Therefore, the limiting tangent direction is
\[ \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(Ax_0e^{(A - D)t}, Dy_0\right)
= (0, Dy_0), \]
which is on the $y$-axis.  So our conjecture is indeed true.
