\begin{exercise} \label{c3.4.3}
Use the phase plane picture given in Figure~\ref{pp_dsp1} to
draw the time series $x(t)$ when $(x(0),y(0)) =
\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$.  Check your answer using {\pplane}.

\begin{solution}

We are given $x(0) = \frac{1}{2}$.  Figure \ref{pp_dsp1}
shows that $x$ increases as $t$
increases, and that $x$ limits on $0$ as $t$ decreases.  From
this information, we can sketch a graph of $x(t)$ for the system.
The graph should be similar to Figure \ref{c3.4.3}, which can
be viewed in \Matlab by entering the system in {\pplane},
then choosing ``{\tt x vs.\ t}'' from the graph menu.
