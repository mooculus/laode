For the three choices of $a$ and $d$ in the uncoupled system of
linear differential equations in Exercises~\ref{E:uncoupleda} -- 
\ref{E:uncoupledc}, use {\pplane}
to compute phase portraits.  Use {\sf Keyboard input} to look at
solutions with initial conditions on the $x$ and $y$ axes.  As time
$t$ increases, do solutions with these initial conditions tend towards 
or away from the origin?

\begin{solution}

(a) Solutions with initial points on the $y$-axis approach the
origin as $t$ increases.  Solutions with initial points on the
$x$-axis go away from the origin as $t$ increases.  Initial points
on the $x$ and $y$-axes are shown in Figure~\ref{c3.4.4}a.

(b) Solutions with initial points on either axis approach the
origin as $t$ increases.  However, points on the $x$-axis
approach slowly because the value of $A$ is small, so the \Matlab
graph, shown in Figure~\ref{c3.4.4}b, is incomplete.

(c) Solutions on the $y$-axis approach the origin as $t$
increases.  Solutions on the $x$-axis do not move, since
$\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.  Initial conditions for this system are shown
in Figure~\ref{c3.4.4}c.
