\begin{computerExercise} \label{c3.4.7}
Use {\pplane} to compute several solutions of the linear system by
setting $a=2$ and $d=-3$ in the region $x,y\in[-5,5]$.  Then use
{\dfield} to compute several solutions of the single differential
equation
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{2x}{3t}
\]
for $x,t\in[-5,5]$.  Is there a relationship between solutions to the
two equations and can you explain what that relationship is?

\begin{solution}

\ans Sets of identical initial conditions have identical trajectories
for the two systems. 

\soln To see this, graph the systems using {\pplane} and
{\tt dfield5}, then use keyboard input to enter several sets of initial
conditions, as shown in Figures~\ref{c3.4.7}a of the {\pplane} system
and \ref{c3.4.7}b of the {\tt dfield5} system.  To see why this is the case,
note that {\pplane} graphs the uncoupled system
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3.4.7}
\frac{dx}{dt} = 2x \AND \frac{dy}{dt} = -3y.
\end{equation}
This is a parameterized system in three variables $(x(t),y(t),t)$.
We can rewrite this system in two variables $(x(y),y)$, by using the
chain rule as follows:
\[ 
-\frac{2x}{3y} = \frac{\frac{dx}{dt}}{\frac{dy}{dt}} = \frac{dx}{dy}. 
\]
Substitute $t$ for $y$ in the new system to verify that \eqref{eq:3.4.7}
is a parameterization of
\[ 
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{2x}{3t}. 
\]
