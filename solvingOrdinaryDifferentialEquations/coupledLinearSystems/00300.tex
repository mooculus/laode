\begin{computerExercise} \label{c3.5.2}
Choose the {\sf linear system} in {\pplane} and set
$a=-1$, $c=3$, and $d=-1$.
Then find a value for $b$ such that the behavior of the
solutions of the system is ``qualitatively'' the same as for a
diagonal system where $a$ and $d$ are negative.  In particular,
the origin should be an asymptotically stable equilibrium and
the solutions should approach that equilibrium along a
distinguished line.

\begin{solution}

\ans The solutions are similar to those for a diagonal system when
$B = 0$.

\soln At this value of $B$, the origin is a stable equilibrium, and the
solutions approach the origin tangent to the line $x = 0$.  When $B < 0$,
the graph is a spiral, so the solutions do not approach the origin along
a distinguished line.  When $B > 0$, the origin is a saddle rather
than a sink; that is, the origin is not an asymptotically stable
equilibrium.  Figure \ref{c3.5.2} shows five sample trajectories
for the system, two of which begin on the $y$-axis.
