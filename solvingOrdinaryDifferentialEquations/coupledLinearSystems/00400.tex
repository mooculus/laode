\begin{exercise} \label{c3.5.3}
Choose the {\sf linear system} in {\pplane} and set
$a=d$ and $b=c$.  Verify that for these systems of differential
equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  When $|a|<b$ typical trajectories approach the line
$y=x$ as $t\to\infty$ and the line $y=-x$ as $t\to -\infty$.
\item[(b)]  Assume that $b$ is positive, $a$ is negative, and $b<-a$. 
With these assumptions show that the origin is a sink and that typical 
trajectories approach the origin tangent to the line $y=x$.
\end{itemize}

Graphs made in {\tt pplane5} using the {\tt axis('equal')} command
verify these statements regarding linear systems where $A = D$
and $B = C$.  Figure \ref{c3.5.3}a, uses $A = D = -1$ and
$B = C = 2$, and shows four sample trajectories which approach
the line $y = x$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.  Figure
\ref{c3.5.3}b graphs the linear system with $A = D = -3$
and $B = C = 2$.  It shows four sample trajectories, three of
which approach the origin tangent to $y = x$.  The fourth
trajectory has an initial point $0 < x_0 = -y_0$ and approaches
the origin on the straight line $y = -x$, which is orthogonal
to $y = x$.
