\noindent We have studied the autonomous linear differential equation 
$\dot{x}=\lambda x$ when $\lambda\neq 0$ and have shown that solutions 
exist for all time and tend either to $0$ or to $\pm\infty$ as $t\to\pm\infty$.
See \eqref{explimits} and Figure~\ref{df_dsp1}.  In Exercises~\ref{c14.1.11a} -- 
\ref{c14.1.11f} explore the behavior of solutions $x(t)$ of the given 
nonlinear (and often nonautonomous) differential equation using {\dfield}.  
Where possible, describe the differences between the behavior of solutions of 
the given differential equation and the linear differential equation.  

\noindent{\bf Hint:}  Here is a list of properties of solutions that are 
{\em not valid\/} for solutions to the linear differential equation:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Solutions blow up in finite time (that is, 
$\lim_{t\to t_0}x(t)=\pm\infty$).
\item[(b)]  Solutions do not exist for all time.
\item[(c)]  Multiple solutions are bounded in both forward and backward time.
(In the linear system only the zero solution $x(t)=0$ is bounded in both 
forward and backward time.)
\item[(d)]  Solutions stop (that is, solutions limit in either forward or 
backward time on a finite value of $x$ in finite time $t$).
\end{itemize}
Use {\dfield} to determine which of these properties of solutions are 
valid for the given differential equations.  Also, when exploring 
Exercises~\ref{c14.1.11a} -- \ref{c14.1.11f} be prepared to use the {\sf Stop}
button in the {\sf DFIELD8 Display} window to stop the numerical integration. 

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c14.1.11a}
$\dps\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{1}{x}$.

\begin{solution}
Figure~\ref{c14.1.11a}a shows several trajectories of the
differential equation.  All solutions limit on $x = 0$ in backward
time.  Trajectories with positive initial values of $x$ increase in
forward time, while trajectories with negative initial values of $x$
decrease in forward time.  Figure~\ref{c14.1.11a}b shows several trajectories
of the linear differential equation $\dot{x} = x$.  The trajectories of this
system also limit on $x = 0$ in backward time and diverge in forward time.

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c14.1.11b}
$\dps\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{1}{tx}$.

\begin{solution}
Figure~\ref{c14.1.11b} shows several trajectories of the
differential equation.  Let $x_0 = x(t_0)$ be the initial condition of
a solution.  All solutions with $t_0 > 0$ limit on $x = 0$ in backward time,
and all solutions with $t_0 < 0$ limit on $x_0$ in forward time.  In the
other direction, all solutions with $x_0 > 0$ go to infinity, while all
solutions with $x_0 < 0$ go to negative infinity.

Figure~\ref{c14.1.11e} shows several trajectories of the
differential equation.  The equation has constant solutions $x(t) = 0$,
$x(t) = -1$ and $x(t) = 1$.  All solutions with initial conditions
$x_0 = x(t_0)$ such that $|x_0| < 1$ limit on $x = 0$ in backward time and
limit on $x = 1$ or $x = -1$ in forward time.  All other solutions limit
on $x = 1$ or $x = -1$ in backward time and diverge in forward time.
