\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c4.10A.4a} -- \ref{c4.10A.4b}, find the solution 
to $\dot{X} = CX$ satisfying $X(0)=X_0$ in two different ways, as follows.  
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Use {\pplane} to find $X(0.5)$.  {\bf Hint}: Use the 
{\sf Appearance} window in {\pplane} to compute the solution from 
$t_{min} = 0$ to $t_{max}=0.5$.
Then use the {\sf zoom in square} 
feature to determine an answer to three decimal places.  
\item[(b)]  Next use \Matlab to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $C$ 
and to find a closed form solution $X(t)$.  Use this formula to evaluate 
$X(0.5)$ to three decimal places.    
\item[(c)]  Do the two answers agree?
\end{itemize}
\begin{computerExercise}  \label{c4.10A.4a}  
$C = \mattwo{2.65}{-2.34}{-1.5}{-1.2} \AND X_0=\vectwo{0.5}{0.1}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans $X(0.5) = (0.155,0.386)^t$ and the two methods agree to three 
decimal places.

\soln (a) The result of the {\pplane} integration is given in 
Figure~\ref{c4.10A.4a}a. After zooming several times we arrive at
Figure~\ref{c4.10A.4a}b.  By inspection $X(0.5)=(0.155,0.386)$.

(b)  Enter the matrix $C$ into \Matlab by typing
\begin{verbatim}
C = [2.65 -2.34; -1.5 -1.2];
\end{verbatim}
Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix by typing {\tt [V,D] = eig(C)}
and obtaining
\begin{verbatim}
V =
    0.9510    0.4525
   -0.3093    0.8918
D =
    3.4112         0
         0   -1.9612
\end{verbatim}
Therefore the general solution to this differential equation is:
\[
X(t) = \alpha e^{3.4112 t}\vectwo{0.9510}{-0.3093} +
\beta e^{-1.9612 t}\vectwo{0.4525}{0.8918}.
\]
It follows that 
\[
X(0) = V \vectwo{\alpha}{\beta}
\]
Therefore,
\[
\vectwo{\alpha}{\beta} = V\inv X_0 = 
\mattwo{0.9510}{0.4525}{-0.3093}{0.8918}\vectwo{0.5}{1.0} = \vectwo{-0.0067}{1.1191}
\]
The last calculation is done by typing {\tt coeff = inv(V)*[0.5;1.0]}. 
Therefore, the solution to the initial value problem is:
\[
X(t) = -0.0067e^{3.4112 t}\vectwo{0.9510}{-0.3093} +
1.1191e^{-1.9612 t}\vectwo{0.4525}{0.8918}.
\]
We can evaluate $X(0.5)$ in \Matlab by typing
\begin{verbatim}
X5 = coeff(1)*exp(D(1,1)*0.5)*V(:,1) + coeff(2)*exp(D(2,2)*0.5)*V(:,2)
\end{verbatim}
and obtaining
\begin{verbatim}
X5 =
    0.1547
    0.3858
\end{verbatim}


(c)  The two answers agree to three decimal places.

\begin{computerExercise}  \label{c4.10A.4b}  
$C = \mattwo{1.2}{2.4}{0.6}{-3.5} \AND X_0=\vectwo{0.5}{0.7}$.

\begin{solution}
\ans $X(0.5) = (1.621,0.291)^t$ and the two methods agree to three 
decimal places.

\soln (a) The result of the {\pplane} integration is given in 
Figure~\ref{c4.10A.4b}a. After zooming several times we arrive at
Figure~\ref{c4.10A.4b}b.  By inspection $X(0.5)=(1.621,0.291)$.

(b) (b)  Enter the matrix $C$ into \Matlab by typing
\begin{verbatim}
C = [1.2 2.4; 0.6 -3.5];
\end{verbatim}
Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix by typing {\tt [V,D] = eig(C)}
and obtaining
\begin{verbatim}
V =
    0.9928   -0.4335
    0.1194    0.9011
D =
    1.4887         0
         0   -3.7887
\end{verbatim}
Therefore the general solution to this differential equation is:
\[
X(t) = \alpha e^{1.4887 t}\vectwo{0.9928}{0.1194} +
\beta e^{-3.7887 t}\vectwo{-0.4335}{0.9011}.
\]
It follows that 
\[
X(0) = V \vectwo{\alpha}{\beta}
\]
Therefore,
\[
\vectwo{\alpha}{\beta} = V\inv X_0 = 
\mattwo{0.9928}{-0.4335}{0.1194}{0.9011}\vectwo{0.5}{0.7} = \vectwo{0.7967}{0.6712}
\]
The last calculation is done by typing {\tt coeff = inv(V)*[0.5;0.7]}. 
Therefore, the solution to the initial value problem is:
\[
X(t) = 0.7967e^{1.4887 t}\vectwo{0.9928}{0.1194} +
0.6712e^{-3.7887 t}\vectwo{-0.4335}{0.9011}.
\]
We can evaluate $X(0.5)$ in \Matlab by typing
\begin{verbatim}
X5 = coeff(1)*exp(D(1,1)*0.5)*V(:,1) + coeff(2)*exp(D(2,2)*0.5)*V(:,2)
\end{verbatim}
and obtaining
\begin{verbatim}
X5 =
    1.6213
    0.2912
\end{verbatim}

(c)  The two answers agree to three decimal places.
