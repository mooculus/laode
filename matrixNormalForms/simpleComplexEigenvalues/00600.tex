Consider the $2\times 2$ matrix
\[
A = \mattwo{-0.8318}{-1.9755}{0.9878}{1.1437}.
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Use \Matlab to find the complex conjugate eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors of $A$.
\item[(b)]  Find the real block diagonal normal form of $A$ and describe
geometrically the motion of this normal form on the plane.
\item[(c)]  Using {\sf map} describe geometrically how $A$ maps vectors in 
the plane to vectors in the plane. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) Enter the matrix in \Matlabp, then type {\tt [S,D] = eig(A)} to
find the eigenvectors 
S =
 
   0.8165             0.8165
  -0.4082 - 0.4083i  -0.4082 + 0.4083i

$v_1 = (0.8165, -0.4082 - 0.4083i)^t$ and
$v_2 = (0.8165, -0.4082 + 0.4083i)^t$ with eigenvalues
$\lambda_1 = 0.1559 + 0.9878i$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.1559 - 0.9878i$.

(b) The real block diagonal normal form of $A$ is
\[
R = \mattwo{\sigma}{-\tau}{\tau}{\sigma} = \mattwo{0.1559}{-0.9878}
{0.9878}{0.1559}
\]
where $\lambda_1 = \sigma + i\tau$.  Note that $|\lambda_j|=1$.  
This matrix rotates a vector through an angle of 
$\cos^{-1}(0.1559) \approx \sqrt{2}$, and does not alter its length.  


(c) In this case, the matrix rotates and dilatates the vector so that
the endpoints of the iterated vectors lie on an ellipse.
