In this chapter we generalize to $n\times n$ matrices the theory of matrix 
normal forms presented in Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar} for $2\times 2$ 
matrices.  In this theory we ask: What is the simplest form that a matrix 
can have up to {\em similarity\/}.  After first presenting several 
preliminary results, the theory culminates in the Jordan normal form theorem, Theorem~\ref{T:Jordan}. 

The first of the matrix normal form results --- every matrix with 
$n$ distinct real eigenvalues can be diagonalized --- is presented 
in Section~\ref{S:RDM}.  The basic idea is that when a matrix has $n$
distinct real eigenvalues, then it has $n$ linearly independent 
eigenvectors.  In Section~\ref{S:CSE} we discuss matrix normal forms 
when the matrix has $n$ distinct eigenvalues some of which are complex.  
When an $n\times n$ matrix has fewer than $n$ linearly independent 
eigenvectors, it must have multiple eigenvalues and generalized eigenvectors.  
This topic is discussed in Section~\ref{S:MGE}.  The Jordan normal form theorem 
is introduced in Section~\ref{S:JNF} and describes similarity of matrices when 
the matrix has fewer than $n$ independent eigenvectors.  The proof is 
given in Appendix~\ref{S:Jordan}.

We introduced Markov matrices in Section~\ref{S:TransitionApplied}.  
One of the theorems discussed there has a proof that relies on the 
Jordan normal form theorem, and we prove this theorem in 
Appendix~\ref{S:TransitionTheory}.
