\begin{exercise} \label{c7.7.3}
Perform the same computational experiment as described in
Exercises~\ref{exer:powita} -- \ref{exer:powitc} using the matrix
$A=\mattwo{0}{2}{2}{0}$
and the program {\sf map}.  How do your results differ from the results
in those exercises and why?

\begin{solution}

In this case, for any vector $v_0 = (x,y)$, the result of the iteration
is $v_1 = Av_0 = 2(y,x)$.  That is, any vector multiplied by $A$ is
reflected across the line $y = x$ and doubled in length.  The result
is different from that in Exercises~\ref{exer:powita} -- \ref{exer:powitc}
because the eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = -2$, so
$|\lambda_1| = |\lambda_2|$.
