Let $W\subset\R^n$ be a subspace and $x_0\in\R^n$ be a vector.  In this
section we solve a basic geometric problem and investigate some of its
consequences.  The problem is:
\begin{quote}
Find a vector $w_0\in W$ that is the nearest vector in $W$ to $x_0$.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[htb]

        \caption{Approximation of $x_0$ by $w_0\in W$ by least squares.}
        \label{F:nearest}
\end{figure}


The distance between two vectors\index{distance!between vectors}
$v$ and $w$ is $||v-w||$ and the geometric
problem can be rephrased as follows: find a vector $w_0\in W$ such that
\begin{equation}  \label{E:leastsq}
||x_0-w_0||\leq ||x_0-w|| \quad \forall w\in W.
\end{equation}
Condition \eqref{E:leastsq} is called the
{\em least squares approximation}\index{least squares!approximation}.
In order to see where this name comes from we write\eqref{E:leastsq} in the
equivalent form
\[
||x_0-w_0||^2\leq ||x_0-w||^2 \quad \forall w\in W.
\]
This form means that for $w=w_0$ the sum of the squares of the
components of the vector $x_0-w$ is minimal.

Before continuing, we state and prove the {\em Law of Phythagorus\/}.
\index{Law of Phythagorus}  Let $z_1,z_2\in\R^n$ be orthogonal vectors.  Then 
\begin{equation} \label{E:LP}
||z_1+z_2||^2 = ||z_1||^2 + ||z_2||^2.
\end{equation}
To verify \eqref{E:LP} calculate 
\begin{align*}
  ||z_1+z_2||^2&=(z_1+z_2)\cdot(z_1+z_2) \\
  &=z_1\cdot z_1 +2z_1\cdot z_2+z_2\cdot z_2 \\
  &=||z_1||^2 + 2z_1\cdot z_2 +||z_2||^2.
\end{align*}
Since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are orthogonal, $z_1\cdot z_2=0$ and the Law of 
Phythagorus is valid.

Using \eqref{E:leastsq} and \eqref{E:LP}, we can rephrase the minimum distance 
problem as follows.
\begin{lemma}  \label{L:orthoLSA}
The vector $w_0\in W$ is the closest vector to $x_0\in\R^n$ if the vector 
$x_0-w_0$ is orthogonal to every vector in $W$. (See Figure~\ref{F:nearest}.)
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Write $x_0-w=z_1+z_2$ where $z_1=x_0-w_0$ and $z_2=w_0-w$.  By 
assumption, $x_0-w_0$ is orthogonal to every vector in $W$; so $z_1$ and 
$z_2\in W$ are orthogonal.  It follows from \eqref{E:LP} that
\[
||x_0-w||^2 = ||x_0-w_0||^2 + ||w_0-w||^2.
\]
Since $||w_0-w||^2\ge 0$, \eqref{E:leastsq} is valid, and $w_0$ is the vector 
nearest to $x_0$ in $W$. \end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Least Squares Distance to a Line}
\index{least squares!distance to a line}
\index{distance!to a line}

Suppose $W$ is as simple a subspace as possible; that is, suppose $W$ is one
dimensional with basis vector $w$.  Since $W$ is one dimensional, a vector
$w_0\in W$ that is closest to $x_0$ must be a multiple of $w$; that is,
$w_0=aw$.  Suppose that we can find a scalar $a$ so that $x_0-aw$ is
orthogonal to every vector in $W$.  Then it follows from
Lemma~\ref{L:orthoLSA} that $w_0$ is the closest vector in $W$ to $x_0$.
To find $a$, calculate
\[
0 = (x_0-aw)\cdot w = x_0\cdot w - a w\cdot w.
\]
Then
\[
a = \frac{x_0\cdot w}{||w||^2}
\]
and
\begin{equation}  \label{E:singleortho}
w_0 = \frac{x_0\cdot w}{||w||^2} w.
\end{equation}
Observe that $||w||^2\not=0$ since $w$ is a basis vector.

For example, if $x_0=(1,2,-1,3)\in\R^4$ and $w=(0,1,2,3)$.  The the vector
$w_0$ in the space spanned by $w$ that is nearest to $x_0$ is
\[
w_0 = \frac{9}{14}w
\]
since $x_0\cdot w=9$ and $||w||^2=14$.

\subsubsection*{Least Squares Distance to a Subspace}
\index{least squares!distance to a subspace}
\index{distance!to a subspace}

Similarly, using Lemma~\ref{L:orthoLSA} we can solve the general least
squares problem by solving a system of linear equations.  Let
$w_1,\ldots,w_k$ be a basis for $W$ and suppose that
\[
w_0 = \alpha_1w_1 + \cdots + \alpha_kw_k
\]
for some scalars $\alpha_i$.  We now show how to find these scalars.

\begin{theorem}  \label{T:nearestvector}
Let $x_0\in\R^n$ be a vector, and let $\{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}$ be a
basis\index{basis} for the subspace\index{subspace} $W\subset\R^n$.
Then
\[
w_0 = \alpha_1w_1 + \cdots + \alpha_kw_k
\]
is the nearest vector in $W$ to $x_0$ when
\begin{equation}  \label{E:nearestvector}
\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha_1 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha_k \end{array}\right) =
(A^tA)\inv A^tx_0,
\end{equation}
where $A=(w_1|\cdots|w_k)$ is the $n\times k$ matrix whose columns are the
basis vectors of $W$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Observe that the vector $x_0-w_0$ is orthogonal to every vector in $W$
precisely when $x_0-w_0$ is orthogonal to each basis vector $w_j$.  It
follows from Lemma~\ref{L:orthoLSA} that $w_0$ is the closest vector to $x_0$
in $W$ if
\[
(x_0-w_0)\cdot w_j = 0
\]
for every $j$.  That is, if
\[
w_0\cdot w_j = x_0\cdot w_j
\]
for every $j$.  These equations can be rewritten as a system of equations in
terms of the $\alpha_i$, as follows:
\begin{equation}  \label{E:dots}
 \begin{array}{ccc}
w_1\cdot w_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + w_1\cdot w_k\alpha_k & = & w_1\cdot x_0\\
 & \vdots &  \\
w_k\cdot w_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + w_k\cdot w_k\alpha_k & = & w_k\cdot x_0.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Note that if $u,v\in\R^n$ are column vectors, then $u\cdot v= u^tv$. Therefore,
we can rewrite \eqref{E:dots} as
\[
A^tA \left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha_1\\ \vdots \\ \alpha_k \end{array}\right) =
A^tx_0,
\]
where $A$ is the matrix whose columns are the $w_j$ and $x_0$ is viewed as a
column vector.  Note that the matrix $A^tA$ is a $k\times k$ matrix.

We claim that $A^tA$ is invertible.  To verify this claim, it suffices to
show that the null space\index{null space}
of $A^tA$ is zero; that is, if $A^tA z = 0$ for some
$z\in\R^k$, then $z=0$.  First, calculate
\[
||Az||^2 = Az\cdot Az = (Az)^tAz = z^tA^tAz= z^t0 = 0.
\]
It follows that $Az=0$.  Now if we let $z=(z_1,\ldots,z_k)^t$, then the
equation $Az=0$ may be rewritten as
\[
z_1w_1 + \cdots + z_kw_k = 0.
\]
Since the $w_j$ are linearly independent, it follows that the $z_j=0$.  In
particular, $z=0$.  Since $A^tA$ is invertible, \eqref{E:nearestvector} is
valid, and the theorem is proved. \end{proof}


\subsection*{Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization Process}
\index{Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization}

Suppose that ${\cal W} = \{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}$ is a basis for the subspace
$V\subset\R^n$.  There is a natural process by which the ${\cal W}$ basis
can be transformed into an
orthonormal basis\index{basis!orthonormal}
${\cal V}$ of $V$.  This
process proceeds inductively on the $w_j$; the orthonormal vectors
$v_1,\ldots,v_k$ can be chosen so that
\[
\Span\{v_1,\ldots,v_j\} = \Span\{w_1,\ldots,w_j\}
\]
\index{span}
for each $j\leq k$.  Moreover, the $v_j$ are chosen using the theory of
least squares that we have just discussed.

\subsubsection*{The Case $j=2$}

To gain a feeling for how the induction process works, we verify the case
$j=2$.  Set
\begin{equation}  \label{E:ortho1}
v_1 = \frac{1}{||w_1||}w_1;
\end{equation}
so $v_1$ points in the same direction as $w_1$ and has unit length, that is,
$v_1\cdot v_1=1$.  The normalization is shown in Figure~\ref{F:gram}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
        \centerline{%
        \psfig{file=../figures/gram.eps,width=2.0in}}
        \caption{Planar illustration of Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization.}
        \label{F:gram}
\end{figure}

Next, we find a unit length vector $v'_2$ in the plane spanned by $w_1$ and
$w_2$ that is perpendicular\index{perpendicular}
to $v_1$. Let $w_0$ be the vector on the line
generated by $v_1$ that is nearest to $w_2$.  It follows from
\eqref{E:singleortho} that
\[
w_0 = \frac{w_2\cdot v_1}{||v_1||^2}v_1 = (w_2\cdot v_1) v_1.
\]
The vector $w_0$ is shown on Figure~\ref{F:gram} and, as
Lemma~\ref{L:orthoLSA} states, the vector $v_2'=w_2-w_0$ is perpendicular to
$v_1$. That is,
\begin{equation}  \label{E:ortho2}
v'_2 = w_2 - (w_2\cdot v_1) v_1
\end{equation}
is orthogonal\index{orthogonal} to $v_1$.

Finally, set
\begin{equation}  \label{E:ortho3}
v_2 = \frac{1}{||v'_2||}v'_2
\end{equation}
so that $v_2$ has unit length.  Since $v_2$ and $v'_2$ point in the
same direction, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are orthogonal.  Note also that $v_1$ and
$v_2$ are linear combinations of $w_1$ and $w_2$.  Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are
orthogonal, they are linearly independent.  It follows that
\[
\Span\{v_1,v_2\} = \Span\{w_1,w_2\}.
\]

In summary: computing $v_1$ and $v_2$ using \eqref{E:ortho1}, \eqref{E:ortho2}
and \eqref{E:ortho3} yields an orthonormal basis for the
plane\index{plane} spanned by $w_1$ and $w_2$.

\subsubsection*{The General Case}

\begin{theorem} (Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization) \label{T:orthobasis}
Let $w_1,\ldots,w_k$ be a basis for the subspace $W\subset\R^n$.  Define
$v_1$ as in \eqref{E:ortho1} and then define inductively
\begin{align}
  v'_{j+1} & =  w_{j+1} -[(w_{j+1}\cdot v_1)v_1+ \cdots  +(w_{j+1}\cdot v_j)v_j] \label{E:inductiveGS} \\
v_{j+1} & =  \frac{1}{||v'_{j+1}||}v'_{j+1}. \label{eq:gsnormal}
\end{align}
Then $\mathrm{span}\{v_1,\ldots,v_j\}=\mathrm{span}\{w_1,\ldots,w_j\}$ 
and $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is an orthonormal basis of $W$. 
\end{theorem}\index{Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization}
\index{basis!orthonormal}

\begin{proof}  We assume that we have constructed orthonormal vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_j$
such that
\[
\Span\{v_1,\ldots,v_j\} = \Span\{w_1,\ldots,w_j\}.
\]
Our purpose is to find a unit vector $v_{j+1}$ that is orthogonal to each $v_i$
and that satisfies
\[
\Span\{v_1,\ldots,v_{j+1}\} = \Span\{w_1,\ldots,w_{j+1}\}.
\]
We construct $v_{j+1}$ in two steps.  First we find a vector $v'_{j+1}$
that is orthogonal to each of the $v_i$ using least squares.  Let $w_0$
be the vector in $\Span\{v_1,\ldots,v_j\}$ that is nearest to $w_{j+1}$.
Theorem~\ref{T:nearestvector} tells us how to make this construction.
Let $A$ be the matrix whose columns are $v_1,\ldots,v_j$.  Then
\eqref{E:nearestvector} states that the coordinates of $w_0$ in the $v_i$ basis
is given by $(A^tA)\inv A^tw_{j+1}$. But since the $v_i$'s are orthonormal,
the matrix $A^tA$ is just $I_k$.  Hence
\[
w_0 =  (w_{j+1}\cdot v_1)v_1 + \cdots + (w_{j+1}\cdot v_j)v_j.
\]
Note that $v'_{j+1}=w_{j+1}-w_0$ is the vector defined in \eqref{E:inductiveGS}.
We claim that $v'_{j+1}=w_{j+1}-w_0$ is orthogonal to $v_k$ for $k\leq j$
and hence to every vector in $\Span\{v_1,\ldots,v_j\}$.  Just calculate
\[
v_{j+1}'\cdot v_k = w_{j+1}\cdot v_k - w_0\cdot v_k =
w_{j+1}\cdot v_k -  w_{j+1}\cdot v_k = 0.
\]
Define $v_{j+1}$ as in
\eqref{eq:gsnormal}.  It follows that $v_1,\ldots,v_{j+1}$ are orthonormal and
that each vector is a linear combination of $w_1,\ldots,w_{j+1}$.  \end{proof}


\subsubsection*{An Example of Orthonormalization}

Let $W\subset\R^4$ be the subspace spanned by the vectors
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:gsexam}
w_1=(1,0,-1,0),\quad w_2=(2,-1,0,1),\quad w_3=(0,0,-2,1).
\end{equation}
We find an orthonormal basis for $W$ using Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization.

\begin{description}
\item[Step 1:]   Set
\[
v_1 = \frac{1}{||w_1||}w_1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,0,-1,0).
\]
\item[Step 2:] Following the Gram-Schmidt process, use \eqref{E:inductiveGS} to
define
\begin{align*}
  v'_2 &= w_2-(w_2\cdot v_1)v_1 \\
  &= (2,-1,0,1)-\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,0,-1,0) \\
  &=(1,-1,1,1).
\end{align*}
Normalization using \eqref{eq:gsnormal} yields
\[
v_2 = \frac{1}{||v'_2||}v'_2 = \frac{1}{2}(1,-1,1,1).
\]
\item[Step 3:] Using \eqref{E:inductiveGS} set
\begin{eqnarray*}
v'_3 &=& w_3-(w_3\cdot v_1)v_1-(w_3\cdot v_2)v_2\\
     &=&(0,0,-2,1) - \sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,0,-1,0) - \\
         & & \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{1}{2}(1,-1,1,1)\\
&=&\frac{1}{4}(-3,-1,-3,5).
\end{eqnarray*}
Normalization using \eqref{eq:gsnormal} yields
\[
v_3 = \frac{1}{||v'_3||}v'_3 = \frac{4}{\sqrt{44}}(-3,-1,-3,5).
\]
\end{description}

Hence we have constructed an orthonormal basis $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ for $W$,
namely
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gsoresult}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
  v_1 & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,0,-1,0) \\
      & \approx & (0.7071,0,-0.7071,0)\\
  v_2 & = & \frac{1}{2}(1,-1,1,1) \\
    & = & (0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5)\\
  v_3 & = & \frac{4}{\sqrt{44}}(-3,-1,-3,5) \\
    & \approx & (-0.4523,-0.1508,-0.4523,0.7538)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Extend this basis to an orthonormal basis of $\R^5$.

An orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by {\tt w1}, {\tt w2},

\begin{verbatim}
v1 = 1/norm(w1)*w1;
v2p = w2 - dot(w2,v1)*v1;
v2 = 1/norm(v2p)*v2p;
v3p = w3 - dot(w3,v1)*v1 - dot(w3,v2)*v2;
