The idea underlying variable step methods is to perform {\em step 
length controls\/}\index{step length control} rather than using steps of 
fixed length.   The strategy is to vary the step size in each step of the 
integration so that a fixed error bound is always maintained.   

More concretely, suppose that we can estimate in step $k$ the error that is
made in the numerical solution.  Then we can use this estimate to find
an appropriate step size $h_{k+1}$ for the next step.  This principle has
the advantage that large step sizes are used when the error bound
is small and small step sizes are used when the error bound is large.
The \Matlab command {\tt ode45}\index{\computer!ode45}
is based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods and it uses step length 
control to solve initial value problems 
numerically\index{initial value problem!numerical solution}.

Rather than explaining step length control mechanisms in detail
we give an example illustrating such a mechanism used in
{\tt ode45}.  Consider the initial value problem
\arraystart
\begin{equation*}  \label{eq:odestepivp}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dps \frac{dx}{dt}(t) & = & -e^{10t}x^2 \\
 x(0) & = & 3.
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
\arrayfinish
Store the right hand side in the m-file {\tt f18\_4\_1.m}
\begin{verbatim}
function f = f18_4_1(t,x)
f = -exp(10*t)*x*x;
\end{verbatim}
and compute an approximation of the solution on the interval
$t\in[0,1.2]$:
\begin{verbatim}
[t,x] = ode45('f18_4_1',[0 1.2],3);
plot(t,x)
xlabel('t')
ylabel('x')
\end{verbatim}\index{\computer!ode45}
The result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ode45step}(a).
In particular, note that the solution is almost linear
for $t\in[0,0.2]$ and indistinguishable from zero for $t>0.8$.
Since the behavior of linear functions is easy to predict, we expect
that the step length control\index{step length control}
mechanism in {\tt ode45} will lead
to larger step sizes in those intervals.  To look at the step
lengths we will have to compute the differences of the consecutive
entries in {\tt t}.  In \Matlab this can be done with the
command {\tt diff}\index{\computer!diff}.  Typing
\begin{verbatim}
dt  = diff(t);
tdt = t(2:length(t));
plot(tdt,dt,'o')
xlabel('t')
ylabel('step lengths')
\end{verbatim}\index{\computer!length}
we obtain the result shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ode45step}(b).
At the beginning of the numerical solution -- within the region
where the solution shows almost linear behavior -- the step sizes
are quite large. Then the step sizes decrease until the almost constant
part is detected by the step length control mechanism and the step
sizes\index{step size} increase again.
At the end the step size becomes smaller, since  the
numerical approximation ends at $t_e = 1.2$ and
the step sizes have to be adjusted to this value.
Altogether {\tt ode45}\index{\computer!ode45}
qualitatively behaves as expected.
