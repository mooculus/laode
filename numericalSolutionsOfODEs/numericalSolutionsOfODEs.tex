In general it is difficult, if not impossible, to find solutions to 
differential equations analytically.   When this happens we rely on the
numerical approximation of solutions, and in this chapter we discuss 
how numerical solutions to initial value 
problems\index{initial value problem!numerical solution} of the form

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dps\frac{dx}{dt}(t) & = & f(t,x(t)) \\
x(t_0) & = & x_0
\end{array}

are found.  This will provide insight into the numerical
techniques used in the \Matlab programs {\dfield},
{\sf pline} and {\pplane}.

The numerical schemes that we consider approximate 
solutions up to a specified accuracy, and
in Section~\ref{sec:DNM} we describe the basic ideas
underlying the construction of such schemes.  In this
section we will see that in general there is an error between 
the numerical approximation and the analytic solution
of the underlying initial value problem.  One of the main
tasks in the numerical analysis of ODEs is to derive bounds
on this error, and in Section~\ref{sec:EEEM} we derive these bounds
for the simplest numerical scheme, {\em Euler's method}.  Finally, 
in Section~\ref{sec:LGEE}
we generalize this treatment and indicate how to derive error 
bounds for arbitrary numerical schemes.  In particular it
turns out that in general the {\em fourth order Runge-Kutta method\/}
leads to much more accurate numerical approximations than 
does Euler's method.
