How many solutions does the equation
\[
A \Matrix{x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3} = \Matrix{2 \\ 1 \\ 2}  
\]
have for the following choices of $A$.  Explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumeratea}
\item $A = \Matrix{1 & 0 & 1\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0}$

\item $A = \Matrix{1 & 3 & 1\\ 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1}$

\item $A = \Matrix{1 & 1 & 1\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1}$
\end{enumeratea}


  
\begin{solution}

\ans (a) no solutions; (b) 1 solution; (c) infinitely many solutions

\soln 
\begin{enumeratea}
\item The third equation in this system is $0 = 1$ and that is inconsistent.

\item $A$ is invertible; so there is 1 solution

\item Reduce the augmented matrix to echelon form. The rank of $A$ is $2$ as is the rank of the augmented matrix.  Therefore, there exists a one-parameter set of solutions.
\end{enumeratea}
