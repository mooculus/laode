\begin{exercise} \label{c2.2.4}
Use \Matlab to determine graphically the geometry of the set of
solutions to the system of equations:
\[
\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
  x & + & 3y & + & 4z  & = & 5\\
 2x & + &  y & + &  z  & = & 1\\
-4x & + & 3y & + & 5z  & = & 7.
\end{array}
\]
Attempt to use \Matlab to find an exact solution to this system
and discuss the implications of your calculations.

{\bf Hint:} After setting up the graphics display in \Matlabp,
you can use the command {\tt view([0,1,0])} \index{\computer!view} to get
a better view of the solution point.

\begin{solution}

\ans The solution set is a line because the three planes intersect in a line.

\soln If the left-hand side of the system is entered into \Matlab as
matrix {\tt A}, and the solution vector is entered as {\tt b}, then
typing {\tt A}$\backslash${\tt b} yields
\begin{verbatim}
Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.
ans =
   Inf
   Inf
   Inf
\end{verbatim}

\end{solution}
