\begin{computerExercise} \label{c2.2.10}
Determine graphically the geometry of the set of solutions to the
system of equations in the three unknowns $x,y,z$:
\[
\begin{array}{rcrcr}
  x & + & 3z  & = & 1\\
 3x & - &  z  & = & 1\\
    &   &  z  & = & 2
\end{array}
\]
by sketching the plane of solutions for each equation individually.
Describe in words why there are no solutions to this system.
(Use \Matlab graphics to verify your sketch.  Note that you should
enter the last equation as {\tt z = 2 - 0*x - 0*y} and the first two
equations with {\tt 0*y} terms.  Try different views --- but include
{\tt view([0 1 0])} as one view.)

\begin{solution}

The system has no solutions because there is no point at which the three
planes intersect.  Figure~\ref{c2.2.10}a shows the \Matlab graph of
the system.  The commands {\tt view([0 -1 0])} and 
{\tt axis([-7 3 -3 3 -1 3])}
produce a view of the graph in which the geometry
can be seen, shown in Figure~\ref{c2.2.10}b.
Since there is no $y$ term in any of the equations, all three planes
are perpendicular to this view, and therefore appear as lines in the
graph.
