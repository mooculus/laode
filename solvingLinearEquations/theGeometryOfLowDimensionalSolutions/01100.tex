Use \Matlab to find an approximate graphical solution to the
three dimensional system of linear equations
\[
\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
 3x & - & 4y & + & 2z  & = & -11\\
 2x & + & 2y & + &  z  & = &   7\\
 -x & + &  y & - & 5z  & = &   7.
\end{array}
\]
Then use \Matlab to find an exact solution.

\begin{solution}

\ans $(x,y,z) = (1,3,-1)$.

\soln The commands to instruct \Matlab to graph this three dimensional
system are:
\begin{verbatim}
[x,y] = meshgrid(-10:0.5:10);
z = (-11 - 3*x + 4*y)/2;
surf(x,y,z)
hold on 
z = 7 - 2*x - 2*y;
surf(x,y,z)
hold on
z = (7 + x - y)/(-5);
surf(x,y,z)
\end{verbatim}
It is hard to determine a solution for the system from this graph.
The command {\tt axis([xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax])} can make the
graph clearer by zooming in on a specific range of points, but a
numerically accurate solution is difficult to obtain graphically in
three dimensions.  Obtain an accurate solution using the command
{\tt A}$\backslash${\tt b} in \Matlabp.
