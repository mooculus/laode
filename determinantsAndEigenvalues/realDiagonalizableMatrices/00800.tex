\begin{exercise} \label{c10.3.6A}
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with a real eigenvalue $\lambda$ and 
associated eigenvector $v$.  Assume that all other eigenvalues of $A$ are
different from $\lambda$.  Let $B$ be an $n\times n$ matrix that commutes
with $A$; that is, $AB=BA$.  Show that $v$ is also an eigenvector for $B$.

\begin{solution}
\soln
We assume that $Av=\lambda v$ and that $AB=BA$.  It follows that 
$ABv=BAv=\lambda Bv$.  Therefore $Bv$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue
$\lambda$.  Since $\lambda$ has only one independent eigenvector, it follows that 
$v$ is a multiple of $v$; that is, there is a scalar $\mu$ such that $Bv=\mu v$.
