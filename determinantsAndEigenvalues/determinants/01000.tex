Suppose that two $n\times p$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are row
equivalent. \index{row!equivalent} Show that there is an invertible
$n\times n$ matrix $P$ such that $B = PA$.

\begin{solution}
\soln
By Proposition~\ref{P:ERO}, every
elementary row operation on $A$ can be represented by an invertible $n
\times n$ matrix $R$.  That is, the matrix $RA$ is row equivalent to
$A$.  If $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent, then there exist matrices
$R_1,\ldots,R_k$ such that $B = R_k\cdots R_1A$.  The product of invertible $n
\times n$ matrices is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix.  Thus $P =
R_k\cdots R_1$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix such that $B =
PA$.
