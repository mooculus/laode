\begin{computerExercise} \label{c14.6.8}
Consider the differential equation
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{2tx+\cos x}{t(t-\sin x)}.
\]
Show that this differential equation is 
exact.  Then use the command {\tt contour}\index{\computer!contour} in \Matlab 
to find solutions.  For the display, 
use the rectangle $[-2,2]\times [-2,2]$ in the $(t,x)$-plane and show contour
lines for the different levels $c=-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4$.  Mark the solution
which satisfies the initial condition $x(1)=0$ by a circle.
{\bf Hint:} Use the same procedure that was used to create 
Figure~\ref{Fig:contour3}.

\begin{solution}
The equation is exact, since it is of the form
$\dps\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{G(t,x)}{H(t,x)}$ with
$-G=\dps\frac{\partial F}{\partial t}$ and
$H=\dps\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ for $F(t,x) = t^2 x + t\cos(x)$.
Now type the commands
\begin{verbatim}
[t,x] = meshgrid(-2:0.05:2,-2:0.05:2);
F = t.^2.*x + t.*cos(x);
cs = contour(t,x,F,[-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4]);
clabel(cs)
hold on
plot(1,0,'o')
xlabel('t')
ylabel('x')
\end{verbatim}
The result is given in Figure~\ref{c14.6.8}.
