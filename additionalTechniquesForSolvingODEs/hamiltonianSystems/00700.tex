Consider the Hamiltonian  $H(x,y) = x^3 + x^2 - y^2$.  Show that the 
associated Hamiltonian system has a homoclinic trajectory.  {\bf Hint:} 
Consider the level curve $H(x,y)=0$.\index{homoclinic}

\begin{solution}

Note that there are two equilibria of this Hamiltonian system: $(0,0)$ and
$(-\frac{2}{3},0)$.  The level contour $H(x,y)=0$ consists of solutions to 
the equation $y^2=x^2+x^3$ and the only equilibrium on this level set is the
origin.  The Jacobian at the origin is
\[
J = \mattwo{0}{-2}{-2}{0}
\]
from which it follows that the origin is a saddle, as $\det(J)=-4<0$. (The
equilibrium at $(-\frac{2}{3},0)$ is a center.)

For each value of $x$ for which $x^2+x^3>0$, there correspond two points of
the level set $y=\pm\sqrt{x^2+x^3}$.  Note that $x^2+x^3>0$ for all 
$x\in(-1,0)$ and $x^2+x^3$ vanishes at the endpoints of this interval. 
Therefore, the level contour contains a circle-like curve emanating from and
returning to the origin.  This curve is a homoclinic trajectory.  See
Figure~\ref{c14.7.10} for the graph of this level set.
