\label{S:GlobalBif}

We have seen one kind of global bifurcation: the homoclinic bifurcation. 
There are two other global bifurcations that are likely to occur in planar 
systems of differential equations depending on one parameter:  a saddle-node
bifurcation of periodic solutions and a heteroclinic trajectory connecting two
different saddle points.

\subsection*{Saddle-Node Bifurcations of Periodic Solutions}

Typically, planar systems have a periodic solution that is not a limit cycle 
when two limit cycles collide and disappear --- very much like the collision 
and destruction of two equilibria in a saddle-node bifurcation.  We illustrate 
this kind of collision using phase--amplitude equations and {\pplane}.
Indeed, the collision of periodic solutions corresponds to a saddle-node 
bifurcation of equilibria in the amplitude equation.
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node}
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node!for periodic solutions}

Let $X=(x,y)$ and consider the system of differential equations 
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{e:papp}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} = a(x^2+y^2,\rho)x - 3y \\
\dot{y} = a(x^2+y^2,\rho)y + 3x,
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
where $r^2=x^2+y^2$ and
\begin{equation}  \label{e:app}  
a(r^2,\rho) = \rho - (r^2-1)^2.
\end{equation} 
Recall from \eqref{e:amplitude},\eqref{e:phase} of Chapter~\ref{C:NPS}
that in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ the 
amplitude equation\index{amplitude!equation} is 
\[
\dot{r} = a(r^2,\rho)r
\]
and the phase equation\index{phase!equation} is
\[
\dot{\theta} = 3.
\]

Recall that zeros of the amplitude equation $a(r^2,\rho)=0$ correspond to 
periodic solutions of \eqref{e:papp}.  When $0<\rho<1$ there are two zeros of 
the amplitude equation \eqref{e:app} that occur at 
\[
r^2 = 1 \pm\sqrt{\rho}.
\]
When $\rho<0$ there are no zeros of the amplitude equation.  
It follows that the amplitude equations undergo a saddle-node 
bifurcation at $(r,\rho)=(1,0)$ and that two periodic solutions of 
\eqref{e:papp} collide and disappear.  This assertion can be 
checked using {\pplane}\index{\computer!pplane8}.  
See Figure~\ref{F:papp}. Note that when $\rho=0$
the circle $r=1$ is the trajectory of a periodic solution but that periodic 
solution is {\em not\/} a limit cycle.  You can see this point by noting that 
trajectories starting at points with $r>1$ asymptote in forward time to the 
periodic solution and that solutions starting at points with $r<1$ move away 
from the unit circle in forward time.

when  $\rho=0$; and no periodic solutions when $\rho<0$.}
           \label{F:papp}
\end{figure*}

In a sense, which we will not make precise, the annihilation of two
limit cycles in the plane through collision typically looks like the 
scenario shown in Figure~\ref{F:papp}.  



\subsection*{Saddle--Saddle Connections: Heteroclinic Trajectories}
\index{saddle-saddle connection}

In Section~\ref{S:bifurcation} we discussed the consequences of having a 
single trajectory connect a saddle point to itself.  As we have seen these 
homoclinic trajectories lead to the disappearance of a limit cycle.

When a single planar trajectory connects two different saddle points, the 
stable orbit of one saddle must become the unstable orbit of the other 
saddle.  This connecting trajectory is called a {\em heteroclinic\/} 
trajectory.\index{trajectory!heteroclinic}

We begin our discussion of heteroclinic connections with a simple example:
\begin{matlabEquation} \label{e:hetero}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = &  x^2-x  \\
\dot{y} & = &  y(0.5-x) + \rho x.
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
When $\rho=0$ the only equilibria of these equations are $(0,0)$ and 
$(1,0)$.  Note that when $y=0$ it follows that $\dot{y}=0$.  Hence
the $x$-axis is an invariant line for the dynamics of this equation. 
Moreover, a short calculation shows that both of these equilibria are 
saddle points and that the $x$-axis is the stable orbit for $(0,0)$
and the unstable orbit\index{unstable!orbit} for $(1,0)$.  
It follows that the line segment 
$(0,1)$ on the $x$-axis is a single trajectory that connects the two
equilibria.  This is an example of a heteroclinic trajectory. See
Figure~\ref{F:hetero}.  The time series for the heteroclinic trajectory 
is given in Figure~\ref{F:heteroT}.  Note the similarity to the time 
series in Figure~\ref{F:pp1dt} of the one dimensional equation 
\eqref{e:1dexample} discussed in the introduction to Chapter~\ref{C:NPS}. (In 
that example the trajectory connected $0$ in negative time to $1$ in positive
time, while in the present example the heteroclinic trajectory connects
$1$ in negative time to $0$ in positive time.)

\begin{figure*}[htb]

	Note the heteroclinic trajectory when $\rho=0$.}
           \label{F:hetero}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}[htb]
           \centerline{%
	   \psfig{file=../figures/heteroT.eps,width=2.5in}}
           \caption{Time series for heteroclinic trajectory 
		in \protect\eqref{e:hetero} when $\rho=0$.}
           \label{F:heteroT}
\end{figure}

When $\rho\neq 0$ the $x$-axis is no longer invariant for the differential 
equation.  The two saddles remain --- but there is no longer a 
trajectory connecting them.  In Figure~\ref{F:hetero} we use 
{\pplane}\index{stable!orbit!in {\pplane}} 
\index{unstable!orbit!in {\pplane}}
to plot the stable and unstable orbits when $\rho=\pm 0.1$.

From this figure we can see how the stable orbit of the origin swings 
through the saddle at $(1,0)$ as the parameter $\rho$ is varied.  This
is typical of the way that a heteroclinic trajectory appears and disappears 
as a parameter is varied.  The fleeting existence of a heteroclinic trajectory
shows how the global fate of stable and unstable orbits emanating from a 
saddle point can change in a drastic fashion.

The following is a complete list of expected transitions between planar 
Morse-Smale systems of different types in systems with one parameter.
\index{Morse-Smale system}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Two equilibria coalesce and disappear in a saddle-node bifurcation.
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node}
\item	A single equilibrium changes from a spiral source to a spiral sink (or 
vice-versa) and spawns a limit cycle in a Hopf bifurcation.
\index{bifurcation!Hopf}
\item	Two limit cycles coalesce in a saddle-node bifurcation of 
periodic solutions\index{bifurcation!saddle-node!of periodic solutions}.
\item	Stable and unstable orbits from distinct saddle points
coalesce and form a heteroclinic trajectory\index{trajectory!heteroclinic}.
\item	Limit cycles grow until they touch a saddle and form a homoclinic 
trajectory\index{trajectory!homoclinic}.

for $\rho=0.7$ and $\rho=1.1$ on the square $-2\leq x,y\leq 2$.  Is there 
a bifurcation between these two values of $\rho$?  If so, what kind of 
bifurcation is it and what is the bifurcation value of $\rho$ to within 
$\pm 0.02$?

\begin{solution}

The system has a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic solutions
at $\rho \approx 0.995$.  Figure~\ref{c9.5.1}a shows the system
with $\rho = 0.7$, at which point there are two limit cycles. 
Figure~\ref{c9.5.1}b shows the system with $\rho = 0.995$, near the point
of collision.  Figure~\ref{c9.5.1}c shows the system with $\rho = 1.1$, where
there are no periodic solutions.

\ans By examination of {\tt pplane5} graphs of \eqref{E:homo2}, a homoclinic
bifurcation occurs near $\rho = -0.027$.

\soln 
Using {\tt pplane5}, graph the system as $\rho$ decreases from $-0.02$, and
note that the periodic solution disappears at when stable and unstable
orbits of the saddle point coincide.  This homoclinic bifurcation occurs
at $\rho \approx -0.027$.  Figure~\ref{c9.6.2c} shows the system with
$\rho = -0.027$.  Note that these figures are created by mapping the stable
and unstable trajectories of the saddle point.

How many periodic solutions does \eqref{E:infinity} appear to have 
when $\rho=0$?  Be careful when answering this question.  First use 
{\pplane} to determine the number of limit cycles on the square 
$-\ell \leq x,y \leq\ell$ when $\ell=2$.  Then compute with $\ell=10$ and 
$\ell=40$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The system appears to have an infinite number of limit cycles
as the size of the computation area increases.

\soln In the region $-2 \leq x,y \leq 2$, the system appears to have no
limit cycles.  However, in the region $-10 \leq x,y \leq 10$, there are
four limit cycles, and there are more in the larger region $-40 \leq x,y

Figure~\ref{c9.6.3b}b shows the system with $\rho = 0.07$.  The system
has two periodic solutions at $\rho = 0.06$, and none at $\rho = 0.07$.
A saddle node bifurcation for periodic solutions occurs between these

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c9.6.4a} -- \ref{c9.6.4c}, consider the system 
of differential equations \eqref{E:twoeq}
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{E:twoeq}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y - x + (x-\rho)^2 \\
\dot{y} & = & y - x^3 +3x
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
in the square $-5 \leq x,y \leq 5$.
\begin{exercise} \label{c9.6.4a}
How many equilibria does \eqref{E:twoeq} have in this square when 
$\rho=1.7$ and of what type are they?  This question can be answered either 
numerically using {\pplane} (easy) or analytically (more difficult, but 
possible).

\begin{solution}

\ans The system has a saddle at $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$, and a 
spiral source at $(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$.

\soln Either determine the equilibria numerically from the {\tt pplane5}
graph of the system (Figure~\ref{c9.6.4b}a), or compute analytically.  To
do this, solve $\dot{y} = 0$ to find that $y = x^3 - 3x$ at all equilibria.
Then, substitute this value for $y$ into $\dot{x}$ and solve $\dot{x} = 0$
to obtain $0 = x^3 + x^2 - 7.4x + 2.89$.  Find the roots of this equation
to confirm that $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$ and $(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$
are equilibria.  There is a third equilibrium at $(x,y) \approx
(-3.4,-29)$ which is not in the graph range.

\para The general Jacobian for the system is
\[
J = \cmattwo{-1 + 2(x - \rho)}{1}{-3x^2 + 3}{1}.
\]
Thus, when $\rho = 1.7$, $\trace(J) = 2(x - 1.7)$ and
$\det(J) = 3x^2 + 2(x - 1.7) - 4$.  At $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$,
$\det(J) \approx -6.1 < 0$, so the equilibrium is a saddle.  At
$(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$, $\det(J) \approx 8.6 > 0$, $\trace(J) \approx
0.6 > 0$, and $D = (\trace(J))^2 - t\det(J) \approx -34 < 0$.  Therefore,
this equilibrium is a spiral source.

What type of bifurcation occurs in \eqref{E:twoeq} as $\rho$ is varied
from $\rho=1.7$ to $\rho=1.85$?

\begin{solution}
A homoclinic bifurcation occurs between $\rho = 1.7$ and
$\rho = 1.85$.  As $\rho$ increases from $\rho = 1.7$, an unstable
orbit of the saddle point crosses a stable orbit of the saddle.  After
this point, there is a periodic solution around the spiral source.

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.6.4c}
What type of bifurcation occurs in \eqref{E:twoeq} as $\rho$ is varied

\begin{solution}
A Hopf bifurcation occurs between $\rho = 1.85$ and
$\rho = 2.1$.  The spiral source passes through a center and becomes a
spiral sink.  At this point, the periodic solution disappears.
