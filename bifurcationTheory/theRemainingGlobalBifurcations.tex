\label{S:GlobalBif}

We have seen one kind of global bifurcation: the homoclinic bifurcation. 
There are two other global bifurcations that are likely to occur in planar 
systems of differential equations depending on one parameter:  a saddle-node
bifurcation of periodic solutions and a heteroclinic trajectory connecting two
different saddle points.

\subsection*{Saddle-Node Bifurcations of Periodic Solutions}

Typically, planar systems have a periodic solution that is not a limit cycle 
when two limit cycles collide and disappear --- very much like the collision 
and destruction of two equilibria in a saddle-node bifurcation.  We illustrate 
this kind of collision using phase--amplitude equations and {\sf pplane5}.
Indeed, the collision of periodic solutions corresponds to a saddle-node 
bifurcation of equilibria in the amplitude equation.
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node}
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node!for periodic solutions}

Let $X=(x,y)$ and consider the system of differential equations 
\begin{equation*}  \label{e:papp}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} = a(x^2+y^2,\rho)x - 3y \\
\dot{y} = a(x^2+y^2,\rho)y + 3x,
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
where $r^2=x^2+y^2$ and
\begin{equation}  \label{e:app}  
a(r^2,\rho) = \rho - (r^2-1)^2.
\end{equation} 
Recall from \Ref{e:amplitude},\Ref{e:phase} of Chapter~\ref{C:NPS}
that in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ the 
amplitude equation\index{amplitude!equation} is 
\[
\dot{r} = a(r^2,\rho)r
\]
and the phase equation\index{phase!equation} is
\[
\dot{\theta} = 3.
\]

Recall that zeros of the amplitude equation $a(r^2,\rho)=0$ correspond to 
periodic solutions of \Ref{e:papp}.  When $0<\rho<1$ there are two zeros of 
the amplitude equation \Ref{e:app} that occur at 
\[
r^2 = 1 \pm\sqrt{\rho}.
\]
When $\rho<0$ there are no zeros of the amplitude equation.  
It follows that the amplitude equations undergo a saddle-node 
bifurcation at $(r,\rho)=(1,0)$ and that two periodic solutions of 
\Ref{e:papp} collide and disappear.  This assertion can be 
checked using {\sf pplane5}\index{\computer!pplane5}.  
See Figure~\ref{F:papp}. Note that when $\rho=0$
the circle $r=1$ is the trajectory of a periodic solution but that periodic 
solution is {\em not\/} a limit cycle.  You can see this point by noting that 
trajectories starting at points with $r>1$ asymptote in forward time to the 
periodic solution and that solutions starting at points with $r<1$ move away 
from the unit circle in forward time.

Note that there are two limit cycles when $\rho>0$; one periodic solution 
when  $\rho=0$; and no periodic solutions when $\rho<0$.}
           \label{F:papp}
\end{figure}

In a sense, which we will not make precise, the annihilation of two
limit cycles in the plane through collision typically looks like the 
scenario shown in Figure~\ref{F:papp}.  



\subsection*{Saddle--Saddle Connections: Heteroclinic Trajectories}
\index{saddle-saddle connection}

In Section~\ref{S:bifurcation} we discussed the consequences of having a 
single trajectory connect a saddle point to itself.  As we have seen these 
homoclinic trajectories lead to the disappearance of a limit cycle.

When a single planar trajectory connects two different saddle points, the 
stable orbit of one saddle must become the unstable orbit of the other 
saddle.  This connecting trajectory is called a {\em heteroclinic\/} 
trajectory.\index{trajectory!heteroclinic}

We begin our discussion of heteroclinic connections with a simple example:
\begin{equation*} \label{e:hetero}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = &  x^2-x  \\
\dot{y} & = &  y(0.5-x) + \rho x.
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
When $\rho=0$ the only equilibria of these equations are $(0,0)$ and 
$(1,0)$.  Note that when $y=0$ it follows that $\dot{y}=0$.  Hence
the $x$-axis is an invariant line for the dynamics of this equation. 
Moreover, a short calculation shows that both of these equilibria are 
saddle points and that the $x$-axis is the stable orbit for $(0,0)$
and the unstable orbit\index{unstable!orbit} for $(1,0)$.  
It follows that the line segment 
$(0,1)$ on the $x$-axis is a single trajectory that connects the two
equilibria.  This is an example of a heteroclinic trajectory. See
Figure~\ref{F:hetero}.  The time series for the heteroclinic trajectory 
is given in Figure~\ref{F:heteroT}.  Note the similarity to the time 
series in Figure~\ref{F:pp1dt} of the one dimensional equation 
\Ref{e:1dexample} discussed in the introduction to Chapter~\ref{C:NPS}. (In 
that example the trajectory connected $0$ in negative time to $1$ in positive
time, while in the present example the heteroclinic trajectory connects
$1$ in negative time to $0$ in positive time.)

\begin{figure}[htb]

	   \psfig{file=figures/heterob.eps,width=2.3in}

 	\vspace*{-0.2in}
	\hspace{0.3in} $\rho=-0.1$  \hspace{1.7in} $\rho=0$
		\hspace{1.8in} $\rho=0.1$ 
           \caption{Phase portraits for \protect\Ref{e:hetero}. 
	Note the heteroclinic trajectory when $\rho=0$.}
           \label{F:hetero}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
           \centerline{%
	   \psfig{file=figures/heteroT.eps,width=2.5in}}
           \caption{Time series for heteroclinic trajectory 
		in \protect\Ref{e:hetero} when $\rho=0$.}
           \label{F:heteroT}
\end{figure}

When $\rho\neq 0$ the $x$-axis is no longer invariant for the differential 
equation.  The two saddles remain --- but there is no longer a 
trajectory connecting them.  In Figure~\ref{F:hetero} we use 
{\sf pplane5}\index{stable!orbit!in {\sf pplane5}} 
\index{unstable!orbit!in {\sf pplane5}}
to plot the stable and unstable orbits when $\rho=\pm 0.1$.

From this figure we can see how the stable orbit of the origin swings 
through the saddle at $(1,0)$ as the parameter $\rho$ is varied.  This
is typical of the way that a heteroclinic trajectory appears and disappears 
as a parameter is varied.  The fleeting existence of a heteroclinic trajectory
shows how the global fate of stable and unstable orbits emanating from a 
saddle point can change in a drastic fashion. 


\subsection*{A Classification of One Parameter Bifurcations}

The following is a complete list of expected transitions between planar 
Morse-Smale systems of different types in systems with one parameter.
\index{Morse-Smale system}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Two equilibria coalesce and disappear in a saddle-node bifurcation.
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node}
\item	A single equilibrium changes from a spiral source to a spiral sink (or 
vice-versa) and spawns a limit cycle in a Hopf bifurcation.
\index{bifurcation!Hopf}
\item	Two limit cycles coalesce in a saddle-node bifurcation of 
periodic solutions\index{bifurcation!saddle-node!of periodic solutions}.
\item	Stable and unstable orbits from distinct saddle points
coalesce and form a heteroclinic trajectory\index{trajectory!heteroclinic}.
\item	Limit cycles grow until they touch a saddle and form a homoclinic 
trajectory\index{trajectory!homoclinic}.
\end{itemize}
