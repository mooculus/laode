\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c9.6.4a} -- \ref{c9.6.4c}, consider the system 
of differential equations \eqref{E:twoeq}
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{E:twoeq}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y - x + (x-\rho)^2 \\
\dot{y} & = & y - x^3 +3x
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
in the square $-5 \leq x,y \leq 5$.
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.4a}
How many equilibria does \eqref{E:twoeq} have in this square when 
$\rho=1.7$ and of what type are they?  This question can be answered either 
numerically using {\pplane} (easy) or analytically (more difficult, but 
possible).

\begin{solution}

\ans The system has a saddle at $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$, and a 
spiral source at $(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$.

\soln Either determine the equilibria numerically from the {\pplane}
graph of the system (Figure~\ref{c9.6.4b}a), or compute analytically.  To
do this, solve $\dot{y} = 0$ to find that $y = x^3 - 3x$ at all equilibria.
Then, substitute this value for $y$ into $\dot{x}$ and solve $\dot{x} = 0$
to obtain $0 = x^3 + x^2 - 7.4x + 2.89$.  Find the roots of this equation
to confirm that $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$ and $(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$
are equilibria.  There is a third equilibrium at $(x,y) \approx
(-3.4,-29)$ which is not in the graph range.

\para The general Jacobian for the system is
\[
J = \cmattwo{-1 + 2(x - \rho)}{1}{-3x^2 + 3}{1}.
\]
Thus, when $\rho = 1.7$, $\trace(J) = 2(x - 1.7)$ and
$\det(J) = 3x^2 + 2(x - 1.7) - 4$.  At $(x,y) \approx (0.4,-1.2)$,
$\det(J) \approx -6.1 < 0$, so the equilibrium is a saddle.  At
$(x,y) \approx (2.0,1.9)$, $\det(J) \approx 8.6 > 0$, $\trace(J) \approx
0.6 > 0$, and $D = (\trace(J))^2 - t\det(J) \approx -34 < 0$.  Therefore,
this equilibrium is a spiral source.

\end{solution}

\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.4b}
What type of bifurcation occurs in \eqref{E:twoeq} as $\rho$ is varied
from $\rho=1.7$ to $\rho=1.85$?

\begin{solution}
A homoclinic bifurcation occurs between $\rho = 1.7$ and
$\rho = 1.85$.  As $\rho$ increases from $\rho = 1.7$, an unstable
orbit of the saddle point crosses a stable orbit of the saddle.  After
this point, there is a periodic solution around the spiral source.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.4c}
What type of bifurcation occurs in \eqref{E:twoeq} as $\rho$ is varied
from $\rho=1.85$ to $\rho=2.1$?

\begin{solution}
A Hopf bifurcation occurs between $\rho = 1.85$ and
$\rho = 2.1$.  The spiral source passes through a center and becomes a
spiral sink.  At this point, the periodic solution disappears.

Figure~\ref{c9.6.4b}a shows the system with $\rho = 1.7$.
Figure~\ref{c9.6.4b}b shows the system with $\rho = 1.85$.
Figure~\ref{c9.6.4b}c shows the system with $\rho = 2.1$.
