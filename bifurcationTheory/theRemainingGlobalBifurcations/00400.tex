\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c9.6.3a} -- \ref{c9.6.3b}, consider the system 
of differential equations \eqref{E:infinity}.
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{E:infinity}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & y \\
\dot{y} & = & -x +\rho y + \frac{1}{2}\cos(x)y
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.3a}
How many periodic solutions does \eqref{E:infinity} appear to have 
when $\rho=0$?  Be careful when answering this question.  First use 
{\pplane} to determine the number of limit cycles on the square 
$-\ell \leq x,y \leq\ell$ when $\ell=2$.  Then compute with $\ell=10$ and 
$\ell=40$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The system appears to have an infinite number of limit cycles
as the size of the computation area increases.

\soln In the region $-2 \leq x,y \leq 2$, the system appears to have no
limit cycles.  However, in the region $-10 \leq x,y \leq 10$, there are
four limit cycles, and there are more in the larger region $-40 \leq x,y
\leq 40$.  Figure~\ref{c9.6.3a} shows the system with $\rho = 0$ on the
square $-10 \leq x,y \leq 10$.

\end{solution}
\end{computerExercise}
\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.6.3b}
Find the number of limit cycles to \eqref{E:infinity} on the square 
with $\ell=7$ when $\rho=0.06$ and when $\rho=0.07$.  Has a bifurcation
 occurred between these two values of $\rho$ and, if so, what kind of 
bifurcation?

\begin{solution}

Figure~\ref{c9.6.3b}a shows the system with $\rho = 0.06$, and 
Figure~\ref{c9.6.3b}b shows the system with $\rho = 0.07$.  The system
has two periodic solutions at $\rho = 0.06$, and none at $\rho = 0.07$.
A saddle node bifurcation for periodic solutions occurs between these
two values of $\rho$.
