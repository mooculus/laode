The simplest steady-state bifurcations --- and the ones that are most
likely to occur --- are the saddle-node bifurcations.  In 
Section~\ref{S:bifurcation} we found necessary conditions for the existence 
of saddle-node bifurcations in one dimension \eqref{E:DCSN} and two 
dimensions \eqref{E:DCSN2}.  In this section we describe necessary and 
sufficient conditions for the existence of saddle-node bifurcations.


\subsection*{Saddle-Node Bifurcation in One Dimension}

Consider the differential equation 
\begin{equation} \label{e:1dbif}
\dot{x} = f(x,\rho),
\end{equation}
that depends on the single parameter $\rho$.  The equilibria are 
found by solving the algebraic equation 
\begin{equation} \label{e:1dstst}
f(x,\rho) = 0.
\end{equation}
We can study how the equilibria in phase portraits for \eqref{e:1dbif} 
change when $\rho$ is varied by plotting
solutions to \eqref{e:1dstst} in the $\rho x$-plane.  The solutions to
\eqref{e:1dstst} form the bifurcation diagram of \eqref{e:1dbif}.

Recall from \eqref{E:DCSN} that  
\begin{equation}  \label{e:1dbifcond}
\begin{array}{rcl}
f(x_0,\rho_0) & = & 0 \\
f_x(x_0,\rho_0) & = & 0.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
are necessary conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation to occur at
$(x_0,\rho_0)$.  The simplest example of a saddle-node bifurcation is:
\begin{equation}  \label{e:1dsaddlenf}
f(x,\rho) = a x^2 + \rho,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a nonzero constant.  The exact bifurcation diagram for 
\eqref{e:1dsaddlenf} depends on the sign of $a$.  See Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle}.  
Note that the bifurcation diagram is just a parabola pointing either to the 
left or to the right.  The general saddle-node bifurcation is one whose 
bifurcation diagram looks `parabolic-like'.  Theorem~\ref{T:saddlenode}
makes this idea precise.

           \label{F:1dsaddle}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}  \label{T:saddlenode} \index{bifurcation!saddle-node}
Suppose that the differential equation \eqref{e:1dbif} has an equilibrium
at $(x_0,\rho_0)$ satisfying the bifurcation conditions \eqref{e:1dbifcond}
and the nondegeneracy conditions\index{nondegeneracy conditions}
\begin{equation}  \label{e:nondegen1}
\begin{array}{rcl} 
f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0) & \neq & 0 \\
f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0) & \neq & 0. 
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Then the bifurcation diagram $f=0$ looks like the diagram in 
Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle} where 
\[
a = \frac{f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0)}{f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}  The proof of this theorem uses the implicit function theorem and
implicit differentiation.  (Technically, we need to assume that the second
derivatives of $f(x,\rho)$ are continuous before proceeding.) Since 
$f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)$ is assumed to be nonzero, the implicit function theorem 
guarantees the existence of a function $R(x)$ such that $R(x_0)=\rho_0$ and
\begin{equation}  \label{e:implicit0}
f(x,R(x))\equiv 0
\end{equation}
for all $x$ near $x_0$.  It follows that the bifurcation diagram $f(x,\rho)=0$
is the graph $\rho = R(x)$.  We claim that $R'(x_0)=0$ and $R''(x_0)\neq 0$. 
Thus the Taylor series of the function $R(x)$ is
\[
R(x) = \rho_0 + \half R''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2 + \cdots 
\]
for all $x$ near $x_0$.  It follows that the bifurcation diagram $f=0$ is
parabolic in shape as in Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle} --- opening either to the 
left or to the right depending on the sign of $R''(x_0)$.

We use implicit differentiation to verify these claims. Differentiating
\eqref{e:implicit0} twice yields 
\begin{equation}  \label{e:implicit1}
f_x(x,R(x)) + f_\rho(x,R(x))R'(x) \equiv 0,
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}  \label{e:implicit2}
f_{xx}(x,R(x)) + 2f_{x\rho}(x,R(x))R'(x) + f_{\rho\rho}(x,R(x))R'(x)^2 
+ f_\rho(x,R(x))R''(x) \equiv 0.
\end{equation}

Evaluating \eqref{e:implicit1} at $x=x_0$ yields
\[
f_x(x_0,\rho_0) + f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)R'(x_0) = 0. 
\]
Since, by assumption, $f_x(x_0,\rho_0)=0$ and $f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)\neq 0$,
it follows that 
\[
R'(x_0)=0.
\]
Evaluating \eqref{e:implicit2} at $x=x_0$ now yields
\[
f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0) +  f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)R''(x_0) = 0
\]
The nondegeneracy assumptions \eqref{e:nondegen1} imply
\[
R''(x_0) = -\frac{f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0)}{f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0)} \neq 0.
\]
Thus $a=-R''(x_0)$.  So when $R''(x_0)>0$ the number $a$ is negative and the
bifurcating branch is supercritical, as in Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle}.  Similarly, 
when $R''(x_0)<0$ the number $a$ is positive and the bifurcating branch is 
subcritical. \end{proof}
 
\subsubsection*{An Example of a One Dimensional Saddle-Node Bifurcation}

Consider the following example of a saddle-node bifurcation.  Let 
\begin{equation}  \label{e:sn1}
f(x,\rho) = -x^3 + 3x^2 - \rho x - 4.
\end{equation}
A quick check shows that $x=2$ is an equilibrium for \eqref{e:sn1} 
when $\rho=0$.  Moreover, 
\[
f(2,0)=0, \quad f_x(2,0)=0, \quad f_\rho(2,0)=-2\neq 0, 
\quad f_{xx}(2,0)=-6\neq 0.
\]
It follows from Theorem~\ref{T:saddlenode} that $f$ has a saddle-node
bifurcation when $\rho=0$ at $x=2$.  Indeed, since $a=\frac{-6}{-2}=3>0$, 
it follows that there are two equilibria near $x=2$ when $\rho<0$ and 
none when $\rho>0$.  See Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle}. This fact can be 
verified using {\sf pline}.  When $\rho$ is small and positive, there is 
one stable equilibrium near $x=-1$.  When $\rho$ is small and negative, there 
are three equilibria --- the stable one near $x=-1$ and two new equilibria 
near $x=2$ formed from the saddle-node bifurcation.  



\subsection*{Saddle-Node Bifurcations in Two Dimensions}
\index{bifurcation!saddle-node}

In higher dimensions, steady-state bifurcations occur at parameter 
values where the Jacobian matrix\index{matrix!Jacobian}
has a zero eigenvalue.  In one dimension,
the $1\times 1$ Jacobian matrix is the number $f_x$.  Such a 
Jacobian matrix has a zero eigenvalue precisely when $f_x$ vanishes
--- which is just the condition in \eqref{e:1dbifcond}.  

In two dimensions, the Jacobian matrix $J$ is a saddle-node matrix when
it has a single zero eigenvalue, that is, when $\det(J)=0$ and 
$\trace(J)\neq 0$.  Now consider the planar system of differential equations 
depending on a parameter $\rho$.  We write this system as
\begin{equation}  \label{e:2deqn}
\dot{X} = F(X,\rho),
\end{equation}
where $X=(x,y)\in\R^2$ and $F=(g,h)$ in coordinates.  Sufficient conditions
for the existence of a saddle-node bifurcation in \eqref{e:2deqn} are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Equation~\eqref{e:2deqn} has an equilibrium at $(X_0,\rho_0)$; so 
\[
F(X_0,\rho_0) = 0.
\]
\item  The Jacobian matrix 
\[
J=(dF)_{(X_0,\rho_0)}=
\mattwo{g_x(X_0,\rho_0)}{g_y(X_0,\rho_0)}{h_x(X_0,\rho_0)}{h_y(X_0,\rho_0)}.
\]
has a zero eigenvalue and a nonzero eigenvalue.  Let $w$ be a nonzero vector 
in the null space of $J^t$.  Assume
\begin{equation}  \label{e:2deig}
w \cdot F_\rho(X_0,\rho_0) \neq 0,
\end{equation}
where $F_\rho=(g_\rho,h_\rho)$.  (In one dimension, \eqref{e:2deig} just states 
that $f_\rho(X_0,\rho_0)$ is nonzero; that is, the first
nondegeneracy condition\index{nondegeneracy conditions} in 
\eqref{e:nondegen1} is valid.) 
\item   Let $v=(v_1,v_2)$ be a nonzero vector in the null space of $J$.
The following is an analogue in two dimensions for the second nondegeneracy
condition in \eqref{e:nondegen1}, $f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0)\neq 0$. Define $F_0$ to 
be the vector
\[
F_0 = v_1^2\vectwo{g_{xx}}{h_{xx}} + 2v_1v_2\vectwo{g_{xy}}{h_{xy}}
+ v_2^2 \vectwo{g_{yy}}{h_{yy}}  
\]
evaluated at $(X_0,\rho_0)$.  The nondegeneracy condition in two dimensions
is:
\begin{equation}  \label{e:2dbifur}
w \cdot F_0 \neq 0.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
A steady-state bifurcation is a {\em saddle-node bifurcation\/} if 
\eqref{e:2deig} and \eqref{e:2dbifur} are valid.  At a saddle-node bifurcation 
two equilibria coalesce as $\rho$ is varied, and the bifurcation diagram 
resembles that in Figure~\ref{F:1dsaddle}.

\subsubsection*{An Example of a Two Dimensional Saddle-Node Bifurcation}

As an example, consider the system of differential equations
\begin{matlabEquation}  \label{e:snex}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\dot{x} & = & \rho + x + 3y -xy & \equiv & g(x,y) \\
\dot{y} & = & -\rho + 2x + 6y + 3x^2 & \equiv & h(x,y).  
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
At $\rho = 0$, \eqref{e:snex} has an equilibrium at the origin with 
Jacobian matrix
\[
J = \mattwo{1}{3}{2}{6}.
\]
Since $\det(J)=0$, the origin is a bifurcation point.  Define the 
vectors $v$ and $w$ by
\[
Jv=0 \AND J^tw=0.
\]
So
\[
v = \vectwo{3}{-1} \AND  w = \vectwo{2}{-1}.
\]
Next compute
\[
F_\rho = \vectwo{1}{-1}.
\]
Therefore
\[
w \cdot F_\rho = \vectwo{2}{-1} \cdot \vectwo{1}{-1} = 3 \neq 0,
\]
and \eqref{e:2deig} is satisfied.  

Next compute
\[
g_{xx}=0, \quad g_{xy}=-1, \quad g_{yy}=0, \quad
h_{xx}=6, \quad h_{xy}=0, \quad h_{yy} = 0.
\]
Hence
\[
F_0 = v_1^2 \vectwo{0}{6} + 2v_1v_2\vectwo{-1}{0} = \vectwo{6}{54},
\]
and 
\[
w\cdot F_0 = \vectwo{2}{-1} \cdot \vectwo{6}{54} = -42 \neq 0.
\]
So \eqref{e:2dbifur} is satisfied. These conditions show that there is
a saddle-node bifurcation at the origin and that two equilibria 
coalesce as $\rho$ varies through zero. 

Some experimentation will convince you that it is complicated to find 
a closed form analytic solution for the equilibria of \eqref{e:snex}.  
We can, however, verify the existence of a saddle-node bifurcation 
using {\sf pplane8}.  The phase plane portraits are shown in 
Figure~\ref{F:snex}.

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.1}
Let 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_1(x,\rho) & = & \rho - x^3 \\
f_2(x,\rho) & = & \rho x - x^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Verify that both $f_1$ and $f_2$ satisfy the bifurcation conditions 
\eqref{e:1dbifcond} at $x=0$ when $\rho=0$.
\item[(b)] Show that neither $f_1$ nor $f_2$ has a saddle-node bifurcation
at $x=0$ when $\rho=0$. 
\item[(c)] Draw the bifurcation diagrams $f_1(x,\rho)=0$ and 
$f_2(x,\rho)=0$ and explain why the conclusion of 
Theorem~\ref{T:saddlenode} is not satisfied for either $f_1$ 
or $f_2$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) A steady-state bifurcation occurs on a function $f(x,\rho)$ at a
point $(x,\rho) = (x_0,\rho_0)$ if $f(x_0,\rho_0) = 0$ and
$f_x(x_0,\rho_0) = 0$.  In this case, let $(x_0,\rho_0) = (0,0)$.
Then
\[ \begin{array}{rcccl}
f_1(x_0,\rho_0) & = & \rho_0 - x_0^3 & = & 0 \\
f_{1x}(x_0,\rho_0) & = & -3x_0^2 & = & 0 \end{array}
\qquad
\begin{array}{rcccl}
f_2(x_0,\rho_0) & = & \rho_0x_0 - x_0^2 & = & 0 \\
f_{2x}(x_0,\rho_0) & = & \rho_0 - 2x_0 & = & 0. \end{array}
\]
Therefore, $f_1$ and $f_2$ have steady-state bifurcations at $(x,\rho)
= (0,0)$.

(b) A saddle-node bifurcation occurs on a function $f(x,\rho)$ at a point
$(x,\rho) = (x_0,\rho_0)$ if $f$ has a steady-state bifurcation at this
point, and if $f_\rho(x_0,\rho_0) \neq 0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0) \neq 0$.
Let $(x_0,\rho_0) = (0,0)$.  Then
\[
f_{1xx}(x_0,\rho_0) = -6x = 0 \AND
f_{2p}(x_0,\rho_0) = x = 0,
\]
so neither $f_1$ nor $f_2$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $x = 0$.

(c) The bifurcation diagram for $f_1$ is shown in Figure~\ref{c9.3.1}a, and
the diagram for $f_2$ is shown in Figure~\ref{c9.3.1}b.  Saddle-node
bifurcations occur only when equilibria appear or disappear.
Figure~\ref{c9.3.1}a shows that $f_1$ has one equilibrium for all $\rho$,
and Figure~\ref{c9.3.1}b shows that $f_2$ has two equilibria for all
$\rho$.  Thus, neither function has a saddle-node bifurcation at the origin.

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.5}
Find all saddle-node bifurcations in the 
family of differential equations
\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = x^3 -5x^2 + 3x + \rho
\end{equation}
analytically.  Draw the bifurcation diagram.

\begin{solution}

\ans Saddle-node bifurcations occur at $(x,\rho)=(3,9)$ and 
$(x,\rho)=(1/3,-13/27)$.

\soln A saddle-node bifurcation can occur only at points where
\[ 
f(x,\rho)=0 \quad \mbox{and}\quad f_x(x,\rho)=0,
\]
that is, 
\[
x^3 -5x^2 + 3x + \rho = 0 \AND 3x^2 -10x +3 = (3x-1)(x-3)=0.
\]
From these equations we see that saddle-nodes can occur only at 
$(x,\rho)=(3,9)$ and at $(x,\rho)=(1/3,-13/27)$. Such points are saddle-nodes 
if, in addition, 
\[
f_\rho(x,\rho)\neq 0 \AND  f_{xx}(x,\rho)\neq 0.
\]
Note that
\[
f_\rho(x,\rho) = 1  \AND  f_{xx}(x,\rho) = 6x - 10.
\]
So $f_\rho$ is never zero and $f_{xx}$ is nonzero when $x=3$ and $x=1/3$.
So there are two saddle-node bifurcations.  The 
bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{c9.3.5}.

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.2}
Let 
\[
f(x,\rho) = x^4 - 6x^3 +8x^2 + 6(x-\rho) - 3.
\]
Show that $f$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $x=3$ when $\rho=1$. 
Are there two equilibria near $x=3$ when $\rho<1$ or when $\rho>1$?

\begin{solution}

\ans There are two equilibria near $x = 3$ when $\rho > 1$.

\soln Calculate
\[
f(3,1) = 0, \quad
f_x(3,1) = 0, \quad
f_\rho(3,1) = -6 \neq 0, \AND
f_{xx}(3,1) = 16 \neq 0.
\]
Therefore, $f$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $x = 3$ when $\rho =
1$.  Note that Theorem~\ref{T:saddlenode} states
that if $a < 0$, then there are two equilibria near $x_0$ for $\rho >
\rho_0$.  In this case,
\[
a = \frac{f_{xx}(x_0,\rho_0)}{f_p(x_0,\rho_0)} = -\frac{8}{3} < 0.
\]

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.3}
Let 
\begin{eqnarray*}
g(x,y,\rho) & = &  \rho - 2x +  y + 2x^2 - y^3 \\
h(x,y,\rho) & = & 2\rho + 4x - 2y -  xy  + y^2
\end{eqnarray*}
Show that $F=(g,h)$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $(x,y)=0$ and 
$\rho=0$.

\begin{solution}

The function $F$ has a bifurcation point at the origin when $\rho = 0$
if $F$ is in equilibrium at $(x,y,\rho) = (0,0,0)$ and $\det(F) = 0$ at
this point.  Since $g(0,0,0) = 0$ and $h(0,0,0) = 0$, the origin is an
equilibrium for $F$ when $\rho = 0$.  Then, calculate the Jacobian at
this point:
\[
J = \mattwo{-2}{1}{4}{-2}.
\]
The determinant of the Jacobian is zero so the origin is indeed a
bifurcation point when $\rho = 0$.  In order to demonstrate the
two-dimensional nondegeneracy conditions, find nonzero vectors $v$ and
$w$ such that $Jv = 0$ and $J^tw = 0$.  In this case, $v = (1,2)^t$ and
$w = (2,1)^t$.  Then, compute
\[
w \cdot F_\rho(0,0,0) = \vectwo{2}{1} \cdot \vectwo{1}{2} =
4 \neq 0,
\]
so \eqref{e:2deig} is satisfied.  In order to satisfy \eqref{e:2dbifur},
compute
\[
g_{xx} = 4, \quad
g_{xy} = 0, \quad
g_{yy} = -6y, \quad
h_{xx} = 0, \quad
h_{xy} = -1, \quad
h_{yy} = 2.
\]
and evaluate
\[
F_0 = \vectwo{4}{0} + 4\vectwo{0}{-1} + 4\vectwo{0}{2} =
\vectwo{4}{1}.
\]
Then, since $w \cdot F_0 = 9 \neq 0$, the second nondegeneracy condition
is satisfied, and the origin is indeed a saddle node bifurcation for $F$
when $\rho = 0$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} \label{c9.3.4}
Let $X=(x,y)$ and 
\[
F(X,\rho) = \rho q + \mattwo{1}{0}{0}{0} X + Q(X)
\]
where
\[
q=\vectwo{q_1}{q_2} \AND Q(X) = \vectwo{\alpha x^2+\beta xy+\gamma y^2}
{\delta x^2 +\epsilon xy+\varphi y^2}.
\]
Show that $F$ has a saddle-node bifurcation at $X=0$ and $\rho=0$ precisely 
when $q_2\neq 0$ and $\varphi\neq 0$. 

\begin{solution}

To show that the origin is a bifurcation point of $F$ when $\rho = 0$, we
must show the following:

(a) $F(0,0) = 0$.

(b) Let $J = dF_{(0,0)}$.  Then $\det(J) = 0$ and $\trace(J) \neq 0$.

(c) There exist nonzero vectors $v$ and $w$ such that $Jv = 0$ and
$J^tw = 0$.

\soln Let
\[
\vectwo{g(X,\rho)}{h(X,\rho)} = F(X,\rho) = 
\cvectwo{\rho q_1 + x + \alpha x^2 + \beta xy + \gamma y^2}
{\rho q_2 + \delta x^2 + \epsilon xy + \varphi y^2}.
\]

(a) Indeed, $g(0,0) = 0 = h(0,0)$, so $F(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.

(b) Find the Jacobian
\[
J = \left.\cmattwo{1 + 2\alpha x + \beta y}{\beta x + 2\gamma y}
{2\delta x + \epsilon y}{\epsilon x + 2\varphi y}\right|_{(0,0)} =
\mattwo{1}{0}{0}{0}.
\]
Since $\det(J) = 0$ and $\trace(J) = 1 \neq 0$, there
is a bifurcation point at the origin with $\rho = 0$.

(c)  To verify that the nondegeneracy conditions are satisfied, find $v$
and $w$.  In this case $v = w = (0,1)^t$.  Then verify
\[
w \cdot F_\rho(X_0,\rho_0) = \vectwo{0}{1} \cdot \vectwo{q_1}{q_2}
= q_2.
\]
So, condition \eqref{e:2deig} is satisfied when $q_2 \neq 0$.  To
verify \eqref{e:2dbifur}, compute the vector
\[
F_0 = 0\vectwo{g_{xx}}{h_{xx}} + 0\vectwo{g_{xy}}{h_{xy}} +
\vectwo{g_{yy}}{h_{yy}} = \vectwo{2\gamma}{2\varphi}
\]
and calculate
\[
w \cdot F_0 = \vectwo{0}{1} \cdot \vectwo{2\gamma}{2\varphi}
= 2\varphi.
\]
So, the origin is a saddle node of $F$ with $\rho = 0$ when
$q_2 \neq 0$ and $\varphi \neq 0$.
