\begin{computerExercise} \label{c9.7.5}
Consider the differential equation:
\begin{matlabEquation} \label{e:homo}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = &  y \\
\dot{y} & = &  -\rho + y + x^2 + xy
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Show analytically that \eqref{e:homo} has two equilibria at 
$(\pm\sqrt{\rho},0)$ when $\rho>0$. 
\item[(b)]  Show analytically that the equilibrium at $(\sqrt{\rho},0)$ is 
always a saddle, while the equilibrium at $(-\sqrt{\rho},0)$ is a spiral sink 
when $1<\rho<97$.  
\item[(c)]  Use {\pplane} to show that the phase portrait of \eqref{e:homo} 
has a homoclinic trajectory between $\rho=1.7$ and $\rho=1.8$.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) The differential equation \eqref{e:homo} is:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = &  y \\
\dot{y} & = &  -\rho + y + x^2 + xy
\end{array}
\]
Solve the system for $\dot{x} = 0 = \dot{y}$ to find that the equilibria
occur at $y = 0$ and $x^2 = \rho$, which is $(\pm\sqrt{\rho},0)$
for $\rho > 0$.

(b)  The Jacobian matrix of these equations is:
\[
J_{(x,y)} = \cmattwo{0}{1}{2x+y}{1+x}.
\]
At the equilibria $(\pm\sqrt{\rho},0)$ the Jacobians are
\[
J_{(\sqrt{\rho},0)}= \cmattwo{0}{1}{2\sqrt{\rho}}{1+\sqrt{\rho}} 
\AND
J_{(-\sqrt{\rho},0)}= \cmattwo{0}{1}{-2\sqrt{\rho}}{1-\sqrt{\rho}}
\]
The first Jacobian has determinant equal to $-2\sqrt{\rho}<0$; so the
first equilibrium is always a saddle.  The second Jacobian has determinant
equal to $2\sqrt{\rho}>0$ and trace equal to $1-\sqrt{\rho}$.  Since the
trace is negative when $\rho>1$, the second equilibrium is a sink.  The
discriminant of the second Jacobian is 
\[
(1-\sqrt{\rho})^2-8\sqrt{\rho}=1-10\sqrt{\rho}+\rho.
\]
The second equilibrium is a spiral when the discriminant is negative, which
it is when $1<\rho<97$.

(c)  Figures~\ref{c9.7.5}a and \ref{c9.7.5}b show that a homoclinic 
bifurcation has occurred between parameter values $\rho=1.7$ (a) and 
$\rho=1.8$ (b) with its characteristic loss of a limit cycle.
