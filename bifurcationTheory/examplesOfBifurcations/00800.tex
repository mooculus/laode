Change the sign of the $\dot{y}$ equation in \eqref{E:ssys}, obtaining the 
system of differential equations:  
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & x^2 - \rho + y \\
\dot{y} & = & y(x^2+1).  \end{array}
\]
Show that a saddle-node bifurcation occurs at $\rho=0$ in this system by 
plotting phase portraits for $\rho=-1$ and $\rho=1$.  How do the 
phase portraits of this system differ from those of \eqref{E:ssys} 
given in Figure~\ref{F:ssys}.

\begin{solution}

\ans When $\rho < 0$, neither system has an equilibrium.  All solutions of
this system limit on the negative $x$-axis in backwards time, while all
solutions of \eqref{E:ssys} limit on the positive $x$-axis in forward time.
When $\rho > 0$, each system has two equilibria along the $x$-axis.  This
system has a saddle at $x < 0$ and a source at $x > 0$, while \eqref{E:ssys}
has a saddle at $x > 0$ and a sink at $x < 0$.

\soln
A saddle node bifurcation can occur only when the Jacobian of a system
at an equilibrium has a zero eigenvalue.  The only equilibrium for this
system occurs at the point $(x,y) = (\pm\sqrt{\rho},0)$.  The Jacobian
at the point $(x,y) = (\sqrt{\rho},0)$ is
\[
J = \cmattwo{2\sqrt{\rho}}{1}{0}{\rho + 1}.
\]
The determinant of $J$ is zero only if $2\sqrt{\rho}(\rho + 1) = 0$, which
occurs when $\rho = 0$.  Thus, $\rho = 0$ is the only point at which a
saddle node bifurcation can occur.  The system is shown in
Figure~\ref{e:source}a with $\rho = -0.1$, and in Figure~\ref{e:source}b
with $\rho = 0.1$.  There are no equilibria when $\rho = -0.1$, and two
when $\rho = 0.1$, so there is indeed a saddle node bifurcation when
$\rho = 0$.
