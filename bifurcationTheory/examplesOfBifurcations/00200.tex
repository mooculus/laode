\begin{exercise} \label{c9.7.1}
Show that the differential equation 
\[
\dot{x} = \rho + x^2
\]
undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation at $\rho=0$ where two equilibria 
disappear as $\rho$ increases through $0$.  Draw the bifurcation diagram 
for this differential equation.

\begin{solution}

\ans The bifurcation diagram (Figure~\ref{c9.7.1}) shows two equilibria
vanishing as $\rho$ increases through $0$.

\soln The equilibria of the equation occur when $0 = \frac{dx}{dt} =
\rho + x^2$; that is, when $\rho = -x^2$.  Thus, when $\rho < 0$, there
are two equilibria, at $x = \pm\sqrt{-\rho}$.  When $\rho = 0$, there is
one equilibrium at $x = 0$; and when $\rho > 0$, there are no real
equilibria.  Let $f(x,\rho) = \rho + x^2$.  If $\rho < 0$, 
then $f_x(\sqrt{-\rho},\rho) > 0$ and $f_x(-\sqrt{-\rho},\rho) < 0$. 
Thus, the equilibrium at $x = \sqrt{-\rho}$ is unstable, and the
equilibrium at $x = -\sqrt{-\rho}$ is stable.
