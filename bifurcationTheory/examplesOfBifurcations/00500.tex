The unforced Van der Pol equation is: \index{Van der Pol equation}
\begin{matlabEquation}\label{MATLAB:23}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dot{x} & = & \rho x - y -x^3 \\
\dot{y} & = & x.
\end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}
Verify analytically that the origin is the only equilibrium of this equation
and that the only value of $\rho$ where that equilibrium could be a point of
Hopf bifurcation is $\rho=0$.  Use {\pplane} to verify that there is a 
unique limit cycle when $\rho>0$.

\begin{solution}

Find equilibria in the Van der Pol equations by setting $\dot{y}=0$ 
to obtain $x=0$ and $\dot{x} = 0$ to obtain $y=0$.  This calculation
verifies that $(0,0)$ is the only equilibrium of the Van der Pol system.  

A Hopf bifurcation occurs at the equilibrium at the origin when 
the Jacobian at the origin has zero trace and positive determinant.  
The Jacobian of the Van der Pol system is
\[
J = (dJ)_{(0,0)} = \left.\cmattwo{\rho-3x^2}{-1}{1}{0}\right|_{(0,0)} =
\mattwo{\rho}{-1}{1}{0}.
\]
Thus, $\det(J) = 1 > 0$ and $\trace(J) = \rho$.  Hopf bifurcation can only
occur in this system when $\rho = 0$.  Figure~\ref{c9.4.1}a shows
a {\pplane} graph of the system with $\rho = 0$, and
Figure~\ref{c9.4.1}b shows the system with $\rho = 0.4$.  One limit
cycle can be seen surrounding the origin in this graph.
