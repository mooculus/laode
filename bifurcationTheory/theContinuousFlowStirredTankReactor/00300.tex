\begin{exercise} \label{c9.2.2}
Use {\pplane} to explore the CSTR equations \eqref{e:CSTR} with
parameters:
\[
h=2, \quad Z=0.5, \quad \eta=-0.5, \quad \gamma=5,
\]
for various values of the parameter $\rho$ between $0.46$ and 
$0.51$.  Describe all equilibria and all periodic solutions that 
you find, and how they change as $\rho$ is varied.

\begin{solution}

With these parameter values and $0.46 \leq \rho \leq 0.51$, the system
has one equilibrium near $(-0.4,-0.1)$.  There are two values of $\rho$
at which Hopf bifurcation occurs: $\rho \approx 0.46735$ and
$\rho = 0.5$.  At these values of $\rho$, there is a periodic solution
around the equilibrium.  For $0.46 \leq \rho < 0.46735$ or $0.5 < \rho
\leq 0.51$, the equilibrium is a spiral sink.  Between the two
bifurcations, the equilibrium is a spiral source.  Figure~\ref{c9.2.2}a
shows the {\tt pplane5} graph of the system with $\rho = 4.6$. 
Figure~\ref{c9.2.2}b shows a graph of the system with $\rho = 0.49$,
between the two bifurcation points.  Figure~\ref{c9.2.2}c shows a graph
of the system with $\rho = 0.5$, at one of the Hopf bifurcation points.
The bifurcation diagram of the system is shown in Figure~\ref{c9.2.2}d.
