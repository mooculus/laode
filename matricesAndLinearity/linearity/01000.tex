Argue geometrically that rotation of the plane counterclockwise
through an angle of $45^\circ$ is a linear mapping.  Find a
$2\times 2$ matrix $A$ such that $L_A$ rotates the plane
counterclockwise by $45^\circ$.

\begin{solution}

To see that $L(X + Y) = L(X) + L(Y)$, consider $X$ and $Y$ as
vectors.  These vectors are two sides of a parallelogram with
diagonal $X + Y$, as shown in Figure~\ref{c4.3.9}a.  Rotating
the plane $45^\circ$ counterclockwise has the effect of
rotating the entire parallelogram, as in Figure~\ref{c4.3.9}b.
Therefore, adding $X$ and $Y$ and then rotating the sum
$X + Y$ is the same as rotating $X$ and $Y$ separately and
then adding them.

\para To see that $cL(X) = L(cX)$, note that multiplying a
vector $X$ by a scalar $c$ affects only the length of the vector,
and that rotating the plane affects only the orientation of
the vector.  Therefore, the two operations can be performed in
either order with the same effect.

\para To find the matrix $A$ of this transformation, we can use
\eqref{e:rotmat}:
\[ A = \mattwo{\cos 45^\circ}{-\sin 45^\circ}{\sin 45^\circ}{\cos 45^\circ}
= \mattwo{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}
{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \]
