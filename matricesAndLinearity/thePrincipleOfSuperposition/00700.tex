\begin{exercise}\label{A.3.4.2}

Let $A$ be a $3\times 3$ matrix with rank $2$.  Suppose the linear system $Ax=b$ has two solutions
\[
y = \Matrix{1 \\3 \\4} \AND z = \Matrix{0\\ 0 \\ 1}
\]
Find the full set of solutions to $Ax = b$. 
  
\begin{solution}

\ans Every solution has the form $\Matrix{0\\0\\1} + t \Matrix{1\\3\\3}$ for some real number $t$. 

\soln The system $Ax=b$ is consistent because $y$ and $z$ are solutions.  Furthermore, $A(y-z)=Ay-Az=b-b=0$, which implies that $y-z$ is a solution to the homogeneous system.  Since $A$ has rank $2$, the system has $3 -\rank(A) = 1$ parameter's worth of solutions.  By superposition 
\[
t(y - z) = t \Matrix{1\\3\\3}
\]
solves the homogeneous system and either 
\[
\Matrix{0\\0\\1} + t \Matrix{1\\3\\3}\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\Matrix{1\\3\\4} + t \Matrix{1\\3\\3}
\]
solves the inhomogeneous system.

Note: Geometrically, the set of all solutions to the inhomogeneous system is a line that is parallel to the set of all solutions to the homogeneous system.
