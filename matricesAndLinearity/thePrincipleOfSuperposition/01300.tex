Every solution to the homogeneous

Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with rank $n-1$.  Suppose $u$ and $v$ in $\R^n$ are distinct solutions to the inhomogeneous system $Ax = b$.  Verify that every solution to $Ax = b$ can be written as 
$\alpha u+(1-\alpha)v$ for some $\alpha\in \mathbb R$.

(Hint: idea is similar to Exercise $\ref{A.3.4.2}$.)

\begin{solution}
\soln 

Note that $u-v$ is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous system $Ax = 0$.  Since $\rank(A) = n-1$, according to Theorem $\ref{number}$ (b), every solution to the homogeneous system has the form $\alpha(u-v)$, where $\alpha\in\R$.  Therefore every solution to the inhomogeneous system has the form
\[
\alpha(u-v) + v = \alpha u + (1-\alpha) v
\]
as claimed.

\end{solution}
