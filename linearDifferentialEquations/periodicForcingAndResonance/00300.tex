The following equation describes the behavior of a damped 
spring\index{spring!damped} that is 
forced periodically\index{forcing!periodic}:
\[
\ddot x + 2\dot x + 2x = \sin(2t).
\]
Find real constants $\gamma$ and $\delta$ so that
\[
x_p(t) = \gamma \cos(2t)+ \delta \sin(2t),
\]
is a particular solution of this second order equation.  Write down the
general solution and discuss the behavior of solutions if time $t$
is going to infinity.

\begin{solution}
\ans When $\gamma = -\frac{1}{5}$ and $\delta = -\frac{1}{10}$,
$x_p(t)$ is a solution to the second order equation.  The general solution
is
\[
x(t) = \alpha_1e^{-t}\cos t + \alpha_2e^{-t}\sin t
- \frac{1}{5}\cos(2t) - \frac{1}{10}\sin(2t).
\]
As $t \rightarrow \infty$, $x(t)$ approaches the periodic solution
\[
- \frac{1}{5}\cos(2t) - \frac{1}{10}\sin(2t).
\]
Figure~\ref{c12.5.2} shows $x(t)$ for $0 \leq t \leq 15$ with scalars
$\alpha_1 = 5$ and $\alpha_2 = -2$.

\soln Let $p(D) = D^2 + 2D + 2$ and let $g(t) = \sin(2t)$.  An annihilator
of $g(t)$ is $q(D) = D^2 + 4$.  The eigenvalue $\mu = \pm 2i$ of
$q(D)x = 0q$ is distinct from the eigenvalue $\lambda = -1 \pm i$ of
$p(D)x = 0$.  Thus, the trial space of solutions to $p(D)x = g(t)$ is
\[
y(t) = \gamma\cos(2t) + \delta\sin(2t).
\]
Substitute $y(t)$ into $p(D)x = g(t)$, obtaining
\[
\gamma(-2\cos(2t) - 4\sin(2t)) + \delta(-2\sin(2t) + 4\cos(2t)) = \sin(2t).
\]
Solve this system to obtain $\gamma = -\frac{1}{5}$ and
$\delta = -\frac{1}{10}$.  Obtain the general solution to the inhomogeneous
equation by adding this solution to the general solution to $p(D)x = 0$,
which is
\[
z(t) = \alpha_1e^{-t}\cos t + \alpha_2e^{-t}\sin t.
\]
To find the long term behavior of $x(t)$, note that
\[
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}e^{-t} = 0.
\]
Thus, as $t$ increases, the homogeneous solution damps to zero.
