\subsection*{Periodic Forcing}

A linear second order differential equation is {\em periodically forced\/} 
\index{forcing!periodic} if it has the form
\[
\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + ax = g(t),
\]
where $g(t)$ is periodic in time; that is, $g(t+T) = g(t)$ for some
period $T$.  The simplest kind of forcing is {\em sinusoidal\/} forcing,
\index{forcing!sinusoidal}
that is, $g(t)=\sin(\omega t+ t_0)$ where $\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$ is the 
{\em forcing frequency\/}\index{frequency!forcing} and $t_0$ is a 
{\em phase\/}\index{phase}.  We simplify 
the discussion by choosing the phase $t_0$ so that $g(t)=\cos(\omega t)$ 
and $\omega>0$.

Suppose, in addition, that the homogeneous equation itself has periodic 
solutions\index{periodic solution} with 
{\em internal frequency\/}\index{frequency!internal} 
$\frac{\tau}{2\pi}$.  Such a 
differential equation is $\ddot{x}+\tau^2x=0$; by rescaling time we 
can assume that $\tau=1$.   Thus, the homogeneous equation is 
\[
\ddot x + x = 0,
\]
and the forced equation is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:uspf}
\ddot x + x = \cos(\omega t),
\end{equation}
where $\omega>0$.

We focus on three features of solutions to this equation.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]	Generally, solutions to \eqref{eq:uspf} are quasiperiodic 
\index{motion!quasiperiodic}
having two frequencies\index{frequency} --- just like the torus 
solutions mentioned in Section~\ref{S:NLD}.
\item[(b)]	When the forcing frequency is near the internal frequency, the
solution has beats.
\item[(c)] 	{\em Resonance\/}\index{resonance} occurs when the 
forcing frequency equals the internal frequency.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The Periodically Forced Undamped Spring}
\index{spring!undamped}

One of the simplest examples of a model differential equation with both a
forcing frequency and an internal frequency is the periodically forced 
\index{forcing!periodic} undamped spring.

The motion of a forced undamped spring is described by the spring equation 
given in Chapter~\ref{Chap:Planar}, \eqref{e:springeq} with $\mu = 0$.
To simplify the computations, we set the mass to be $m=1$ and suppose that 
the spring constant is $\kappa=1$.  Then, with periodic forcing 
$g(t)=\cos(\omega t)$, we obtain the differential equation \eqref{eq:uspf}.

\subsection*{Closed Form Solutions to \protect{\eqref{eq:uspf}} by Undetermined 
Coefficients}\index{closed form solution}\index{undetermined coefficients}

We can apply the method of undetermined coefficients to solve \eqref{eq:uspf}, 
but there are two cases: $\omega=1$ and $\omega\neq 1$. 

\subsubsection*{The Case $\omega\not= 1$}  

We use undetermined coefficients to find a particular solution to the 
inhomogeneous equation \eqref{eq:uspf}.  The forcing term $\cos(\omega t)$ is 
a solution to the differential equation 
\begin{equation}  \label{E:omega}
\ddot{y} + \omega^2y = 0.
\end{equation}
Thus the annihilator\index{annihilator} 
of $\cos(\omega t)$ is $q(D)=D^2+\omega^2$.  The 
eigenvalues of the homogeneous equation associated to \eqref{eq:uspf} are 
$\pm i$ and the eigenvalues of $q(\lambda)$ are $\pm\omega i$.  Thus when 
$\omega\neq 1$ we can use undetermined coefficients by choosing the general 
solution to \eqref{E:omega} as the trial space\index{trial!space} 
for \eqref{eq:uspf}.  So we set
\[
y(t) = c_1\cos(\omega t) + c_2\sin(\omega t).
\]
Next, substitute $y$ into \eqref{eq:uspf}, obtaining
\[
(1-\omega ^2)(c_1\cos(\omega t) + c_2\sin(\omega t)) = \cos(\omega t).
\]
This equality holds when 
\[
c_1 = \frac{1}{1-\omega ^2} \AND c_2=0.
\]
Since the general solution\index{general solution} of the 
homogeneous\index{homogeneous} equation associated 
to \eqref{eq:uspf} is
\[
\alpha \cos(t)+\beta\sin(t),
\]
the general solution to \eqref{eq:uspf} is
\[
x(t) =\frac{1}{1-\omega ^2}\cos(\omega t) + \alpha\cos(t) + \beta\sin(t),
\]
when $\omega \neq 1$. 

\subsubsection*{The Case $\omega= 1$}

When $\omega= 1$ the roots of $p(\lambda)$ and $q(\lambda)$ both equal 
$\pm i$.  Thus, to use undetermined coefficients, we must first find the 
general solution to 
\[
p(D)q(D)x = 0.
\]
This solution is 
\[
x(t) = \alpha_1\cos t + \alpha_2\sin t + c_1t\cos t + c_2t\sin t.
\]
On setting the solutions to the homogeneous equation associated to 
\eqref{eq:uspf} to zero (that is, on setting $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=0$), we 
find that the trial space for \eqref{eq:uspf} is:
\[
y(t) = c_1t\cos t + c_2t\sin t.
\]
Substituting $y(t)$ into \eqref{eq:uspf} yields:
\[
\ddot{y} + y \equiv -2c_1\sin t + 2c_2\cos t = \cos t.
\]
Therefore, $c_1=0$ and $c_2=\frac{1}{2}$, and a particular solution of 
\eqref{eq:uspf} is 
\[
x_p(t) = \frac{1}{2}t\sin t.
\]
The general solution can be written as
\[
x(t) = \frac{1}{2}t\sin t+\alpha\cos t+\beta\sin t.
\]

To summarize: the general closed form solution to \eqref{eq:uspf} is
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:uspfsoln}
x(t) = \alpha\cos t+\beta\sin t + \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
\frac{1}{1-\omega ^2}\cos(\omega t)  & 0<\omega\neq 1\\  
\frac{1}{2}t\sin t & \omega=1 \end{array}\right.\end{equation}

\subsection*{Types of Solutions to \eqref{eq:uspf}}

We use the closed form solution \eqref{eq:uspfsoln} to \eqref{eq:uspf} to
identify three different types of solutions: quasiperiodic two-frequency 
motion, beats, and resonance.

\subsubsection*{Quasiperiodic Two Frequency Motion}
\index{motion!two frequency}

In our discussion we now specify initial conditions.  In particular, the 
solution to \eqref{eq:uspf} with initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and 
$\dot{x}(0)=0$ is:
\arraystart
\begin{equation}  \label{e:x(t)reson}
x(t) = \cos t + \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{1-\omega ^2}(\cos(\omega t)-\cos t) & \omega \neq 1 \\
\frac{1}{2}t\sin t & \omega=1  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\arrayfinish
In particular, when $\omega\neq 1$, the solution \eqref{e:x(t)reson} is
just a linear combination of two periodic 
functions\index{linear!combination!of periodic functions} with different 
frequencies\index{frequency}:
\begin{equation} \label{e:x(t)reson2}
x(t) = -\frac{\omega^2}{1-\omega ^2} \cos t + \frac{1}{1-\omega ^2}\cos(\omega t).
\end{equation}
In this way it is straightforward to see that the motion is 
quasiperiodic\index{motion!quasiperiodic}
with two frequencies.

When $\omega$ is far from $1$, the solution is very close to the solution
to the undamped unforced spring equation\index{spring!undamped}.  
Indeed, note that when the frequency
$\omega$ is large, then it follows from \eqref{e:x(t)reson2} that $x(t)$ is 
approximately equal to $\cos t$.  See Figure~\ref{F:nonreson}.

           \caption{Solutions to: (Left) the unforced undamped spring
        equation and (Right) the forced spring equation when $\omega =4.5$.}
           \label{F:nonreson}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Beats}
\index{beats}

Using the trigonometric identity
\[
\cos A - \cos B = -2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)
\sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right),
\]
we find that the solution $x(t)$ is approximately
\begin{equation}  \label{e:x(t)reson3}
x(t) \approx  \frac{1}{1-\omega^2} (\cos(\omega t)-\cos(t))=
\frac{2}{\omega ^2-1}
\sin\left(\frac{\omega+1}{2}t\right)\sin\left(\frac{\omega-1}{2}t\right)
\end{equation}
when $\omega$ is close to $1$.  Note that the first sine term on the right hand
side of \eqref{e:x(t)reson3} has period about $2\pi$ while the second sine term 
has a large period of $4\pi/(\omega-1)$.  For example, when $\omega=1.05$, this
fact leads to periodic behavior of period about $2\pi$ and a 
modulation\index{modulation} 
of period about $80\pi$.  See Figure~\ref{F:beats}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
           \centerline{%
           \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{../figures/beats.pdf}}
           \caption{Beats in the solution $x(t)$ to \protect{\eqref{e:x(t)reson}} 
		when $\omega =1.05$ and $0\leq t\leq 100\pi$.}
           \label{F:beats}
\end{figure}  \index{beats}

\subsubsection*{Resonance}
\index{resonance}

When $\omega = 1$ it follows from \eqref{eq:uspfsoln} that every
solution to \eqref{eq:uspf} is unbounded as $t$ goes to infinity.  This
phenomenon is called {\em resonance\/}, and is due to the fact that the
internal frequency\index{frequency!internal} is the same as the 
forcing frequency\index{frequency!forcing}.  The solution
to \eqref{eq:uspf} for $\omega=1$ is shown in Figure~\ref{F:reson} (right).
Resonance shows that when the forcing frequency equals the internal 
frequency, the forcing amplifies the internal dynamics.

Note that when $\omega$ is close to $1$ the solution follows the solution 
for $\omega =1$ for some length of time.  See Figure~\ref{F:reson} where 
the solutions for $\omega =1.05$ and $\omega =1$ are given.  But it is only 
when $\omega =1$ exactly that unbounded growth or resonance actually occurs 
while the nearby solution has long term modulation or beats.
