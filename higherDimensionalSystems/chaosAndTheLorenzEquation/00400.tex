\begin{exercise} \label{c11.4.3}
Use {\tt ode45} to analyze the dynamical behavior of a variant of the 
{\em Chua circuit}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \dot{x} &=& \alpha\left(y-m_0x-\frac{1}{3}m_1x^3\right) \\
  \dot{y} &=& x-y+z \\
  \dot{z} &=& - \beta y.
\end{eqnarray*}
In the computations, fix $\alpha=18$, $\beta=33$, $m_0=-0.2$, and $m_1=0.01$.
You will have to write your own m-file to complete this exercise. 

\begin{solution}

\ans The system has unstable equilibria at $X_1 = (0,0,0)$,
$X_2 = (\sqrt{60},0, -\sqrt{60})$, and $X_3 = (-\sqrt{60},0,\sqrt{60})$.
Figure~\ref{c11.4.3}a shows the behavior of $x$, $y$, and $z$ as $t$
increases.  Figure~\ref{c11.4.3}b shows the graph of the system created
with the {\tt plot3} command.  Figure~\ref{c11.4.3}c shows the same graph
with an overhead view of the $xz$ plane, and with circles indicating the
locations of the equilibria.  In forward time, trajectories oscillate
between circuits around the two nonzero equilibria.

\soln Find the equilibria by finding the points at which $\dot{x} = 0$,
$\dot{y} = 0$, and $\dot{z} = 0$.  Then, compute the general Jacobian
matrix
\[
dJ = \cmatthree{\alpha(-m_0 - m_1x^2)}{\alpha}{0}{1}{-1}{1}{0}{-\beta}{0}
= \cmatthree{-9 - 0.01x^2}{18}{0}{1}{-1}{1}{0}{-33}{0}.
\]
To see that the equilibria are unstable, find the Jacobian matrices at
each equilibrium.  Also note that most trajectories do not converge on
any of the equilibria in forward time.
