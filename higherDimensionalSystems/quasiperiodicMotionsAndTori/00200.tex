\begin{computerExercise}  \label{EX:tor4}
Let A be the $4\times 4$ torus example given in \eqref{e:tor4}.  Choose three 
different initial conditions to the system of ODEs $\dot{X}=AX$ and use 
{\tt ode45} compute solutions with these initial conditions.  (To decrease 
the length of time needed by the computer to do these calculations, shorten 
the time period to say $[0,30]$.)  
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  Based on these calculations, verify that most initial conditions 
lead to quasiperiodic toroidal motions.  Display both time series and 
three dimensional phase portraits of your solutions. 
\item[(b)]  Take as initial condition the real part of one of the complex
eigenvectors of $A$.  (You will need to use \Matlab to find the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of $A$.)  What kind of phase space motion do you see now? 
How does this solution differ from the toroidal motions obtained in (a)? 
Use Jordan normal forms to explain why your numerical answer is correct.
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}

(a) Let {\tt X0} be an initial condition of your choice, written as a
column vector.  Then the command {\tt [t,x]=ode45('ftor4',0,100,X0)}
will find solutions to the system $\dot{X} = AX$ with initial condition
$X_0$.  For most choices of $X_0$, the graphs are similar to those shown
in Figures~\ref{F:ftor4ts} and \ref{F:ftorphase} in the text.

(b) Load matrix $A$ into \Matlabp.  Then, use the command
{\tt [S,D] = eig(A)} to find that $\lambda = 4.7958i$ is an eigenvalue of
$A$ with corresponding eigenvector $v = (-0.3447 + 0.7587i, 0.0139 +
0.3724i, 0.0800 + 0.1462i, 0.0139 + 0.03724i)$.  Using {\tt ode45}, find
the solutions to the system with initial condition $X_0 = (-0.3447, 0.0139,
0.0800, 0.0139)^t$.  The time series of this system are shown in
Figure~\ref{EX:tor4}a, and three phase portraits are shown in
Figure~\ref{EX:tor4}b.
