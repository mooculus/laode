\exer{c8.1.1}
There are 3 equilibria in the interval $[-3,1]$.  There are
asymptotically stable equilibria at $x\approx -2.910$ and at 
$x\approx 0.925$, and there is an asymptotically unstable equilibrium at
$x \approx -0.408$.  Figure~\ref{c8.1.1} shows the phase line
of the system.

\exer{c8.1.2}
The {\tt pplane5} graph in Figure~\ref{c8.1.2}a shows several trajectories
 of \Ref{e:global2exam} with $a = 1.6$.  Figure~\ref{c8.1.2}b shows
several trajectories of \Ref{e:global2exam} with $a = 1$.  Note that, in
a small neighborhood of the origin, both these graphs of
\Ref{e:global2exam} and the graph of \Ref{e:globalexam} in
Chapter~\ref{C:NPS} resemble the graph of \Ref{e:localexam} in the
chapter.  However, \Ref{e:globalexam} and \Ref{e:global2exam} are
nonlinear systems, and differ from \Ref{e:localexam} and from each other
away from the origin.  Using the {\tt pplane5} command
{\tt Find an equilibrium point}, note that \Ref{e:global2exam} has
three equilibria, while \Ref{e:globalexam} has two.  All three systems
have a saddle point at the origin.  Additionally, when $a = 1.6$,
\Ref{e:global2exam} has a spiral sink at $(x,y) \approx (-1.4832,0)$
and a nodal source at $(x,y) \approx (1.4832,0)$.  When $a = 1$, the
system has spiral sources at both $(x,y) \approx (-1.4832,0)$ and
$(x,y) \approx (1.4832,0)$.

\exer{c8.1.3a}
One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (1,4)$.  The {\tt y vs.\ t}
time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3a}.

\exer{c8.1.3b}
One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (-1,0)$.  The {\tt y vs.\ t}
time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3b}.

\newpage
\exer{c8.1.3c} One valid initial condition is $X(0) = (1,2)$.  The
{\tt y vs.\ t} time series is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.1.3c}.

\para The trajectories in Exercises~\ref{c8.1.3a} and \ref{c8.1.3b} are
similar in backward time, since they limit on similar periodic
solutions as $t \rightarrow -\infty$.  Additionally, the trajectories
in \ref{c8.1.3a} and \ref{c8.1.3c} are similar in forward time, since
both approach infinity in the first quadrant.  In forward time,
\ref{c8.1.3b} approaches $y = 0$, and in backward time, \ref{c8.1.3c}
approaches $y = 0$.

\exer{c8.2.1}
(a) \ans Figure~\ref{c8.2.1}a shows a phase line picture
of this system.

\soln There is a stable equilibrium at $x = 2$, and an unstable
equilibrium at $x = 1$, since $f(x) = -x^2 + 3x - 2 = (x - 1)(2 - x)$,
and since $f'(1) = 1 > 0$ and $f'(2) = -1 < 0$.

(b) \ans $\dps\lim_{t \to \infty} x(t) = -\infty$.

\soln The closest equilibrium to $x(0) = -1$ is $x = 1$, which is
unstable. 

(c) \ans Figure~\ref{c8.2.1}b shows the {\tt dfield5} graph of $y$.

\soln The trajectory of $y(t)$ with initial condition $y(0) = 0.5$ goes
to negative infinity in forward time, and limits on $y = 1$ in
backward time.

\newpage
\exer{E:popex}
\ans The asymptotic limit of the population in forward time is
$\frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

\soln Substitute $\lambda(p)$ into the population model, obtaining
\[
\frac{dp}{dt} = (\lambda_0 - ap)p\equiv f(p).
\]
Solve for $f(p)= 0$ to find that the system has equilibria
at $p = 0$ and $p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.  Then, find that
\[
\frac{df}{dp}(0) = \lambda_0 > 0 \AND
\frac{df}{dp}(\lambda_0/a) = -\lambda_0 < 0;
\]
so the equilibrium at $p = 0$ is unstable and the equilibrium at
$p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a} > 0$ is stable.  Therefore, a solution with 
initial population $p(0) > 0$ limits on $\frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

\exer{c8.2.3}
(a) We are given $\frac{d\lambda}{dp} < 0$ for all $p$.  Thus $\lambda(p)$ is a 
monotonic decreasing function of $p$ when $p>0$ and the graph of 
$\lambda(p)$ can intersect $\lambda=0$ in at most one point.
Therefore, \Ref{E:pop} has at most one positive equilibrium.

(b) \ans If there exists a positive equilibrium $p_e$, then
$\dps\lim_{p \to \infty} p(t) = p_e$.  If no positive equilibrium
exists, then $\dps\lim_{p \to \infty} p(t) = \infty$.

\soln If there is a positive equilibrium, then it is asymptotically stable.
To verify this point differentiate the right hand side of \Ref{E:pop} with respect to 
$p$ and evaluate at $p=p_e$ obtaining
\[
\left.\frac{d}{dp}(\lambda(p)p)\right|_{p=p_e} = 
\lambda(p_e) + \lambda'(p_e)p_e = \lambda'(p_e)p_e <0
\]
since $\lambda(p_e) = 0$, $\lambda'(p_e) < 0$, and $p_e > 0$.  
So $p = p_e$ is a stable equilibrium, and the population limits on
$p_e$.

\para If no positive equilibrium exists, then $p = 0$, which is unstable,
is the only equilibrium, and the population grows without bound.

(c) Exercise~\ref{E:popex} is a specific example of \Ref{E:pop} in
which a positive equilibrium exists at $p = \frac{\lambda_0}{a}$.

\exer{c8.2.4a} \ans The origin is a nodal sink.

\soln A matrix $C$ with nonzero trace and determinant is a hyperbolic
equilibrium.  In this case, $\trace(C) = -2.9$ and $\det(C) = 1.7$.
Since the determinant is positive and the trace is negative, the origin
is a sink. Since the discriminant is $1.61>0$ the origin is a node.

\exer{c8.2.4b} \ans The origin is a spiral source.

\soln In this case, $\trace(C) = 9$ and $\det(C) = 22$, so the origin
is a hyperbolic equilibrium and a source.  Since the discriminant is 
$-1<0$, the origin is a spiral.

\exer{c8.2.4c} \ans The origin is not hyperbolic.

\soln Since $\trace(C) = 0$ and $\det(C) = 0$, the origin is not 
hyperbolic. 

\exer{c8.2.4d} \ans The origin is not hyperbolic.

\soln Since $\det(C) = 0$ the origin is not hyperbolic.

\exer{c8.2.4e} \ans The origin is an improper nodal sink.

\soln Since $\trace(C) = -2$ and $\det(C) = 1$, the equilibrium
is hyperbolic. Since the trace is negative, the origin is a sink.
Since the discriminant is $0$, the origin is an improper node. 

\exer{c8.2.5}
(a) \ans The equilibria occur at $(x,y) = (1,0)$ and $(x,y) = (0,1)$.

\soln Solve $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.

(b) \ans The point $(x,y) = (1,0)$ is a saddle.  The point $(x,y) = (0,1)$
is a spiral sink.

\soln Let $f(x,y) = 1 - x - y$, $g(x,y) = 2xy$,
and $F = (f,g)$.  Then the Jacobian matrix is
\[
(dF)_{(x,y)} = \mattwo{f_x(x,y)}{f_y(x,y)}{g_x(x,y)}{g_y(x,y)}
= \mattwo{-1}{-1}{2y}{2x}.
\]
Specifically, at the equilibrium points:
\[
(dF)_{(1,0)} = \mattwo{-1}{-1}{0}{2} \qquad
(dF)_{(0,1)} = \mattwo{-1}{-1}{2}{0}.
\]
The eigenvalues of $(dF)_{(1,0)}$ are $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = -1$;
so the point is like a saddle in a small neighborhood.  The trace of
$(dF)_{(0,1)}$ is $-1 < 0$ and the determinant is $2 > 0$, so the
discriminant is negative and, within a small neighborhood, the point
is like a spiral sink.

(c) Compute the eigenvectors of the Jacobian of the saddle point $(1,0)$.
The invariant axes of $(1,0)$ are the eigendirections $(1,-3)$ and
$(1,0)$.  Use these vectors to graph the system.  Your sketch should
resemble the {\tt pplane5} graph in Figure~\ref{c8.2.5}.

\end{figure}

\newpage
\exer{c8.2.6}
(a) \ans Equilibria occur at the points $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,1)$.

\soln Solve $0 = y - y^2$ to obtain $y = 1$ and $y = 0$, then substitute
these values for $y$ into $0 = 1 - 2x + y + x^2 - xy$ to find the points
at which $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.

(b) \ans The equilibria at $(1,0)$ and $(2,1)$ are not asymptotically
stable.  The equilibrium at $(1,1)$ is stable.

\soln Compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:
\[
(dJ)_{(x,y)} = \cmattwo{-2 + 2x - y}{1 - x}{0}{1 - 2y}
\]
Specifically, at the equilibrium points, the Jacobian matrices are
\[
(dJ)_{(1,0)} = \mattwo{0}{0}{0}{1} \qquad (dJ)_{(1,1)} =
\mattwo{-1}{0}{0}{-1} \qquad (dJ)_{(2,1)} = \mattwo{1}{-1}{0}{-1}.
\]
An equilibrium is asymptotically stable if both eigenvalues are
negative.  The eigenvalues of $(1,0)$ are $0$ and $1 > 0$.
The point $(1,1)$ has a double eigenvalue at $-1 < 0$.
The eigenvalues of $(1,1)$ are $-1 < 0$ and $1 > 0$.

(c) The equilibrium at $(1,0)$ is a saddle node, since the Jacobian
has one zero eigenvalue and one nonzero eigenvalue.  The equilibrium
at $(1,1)$ is a focus sink, since the Jacobian is a multiple of $I_2$
with negative real eigenvalue.  The equilibrium at $(2,1)$ is a
saddle point, since the Jacobian has one negative and one positive
eigenvalue.

\exer{c8.2.7}
(a) Solving system \Ref{e:global2exam} for $\dot{x} = \dot{y} = 0$
yields equilibria at $(0,0)$, $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$, and $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$.

(b) The general Jacobian matrix for \Ref{e:global2exam} is
\[
(dJ)_{(x,y)} = \cmattwo{0}{1}{2.2 - 3x^2 + ay}{2.1 + ax}.
\]
The Jacobian matrices at the equilibria are:
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
(dJ)_{(0,0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{2.2}{2.1} \\
(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{2.1 + \sqrt{2.2}a} \\
(dJ)_{(-\sqrt{2.2},0)} & = & \cmattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{2.1 - \sqrt{2.2}a}. \\
\end{array}
\]

(c) \ans The Jacobian of the equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is not
hyperbolic at $a = -2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$, and the Jacobian of the
equilibrium at $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is not hyperbolic at
$a = 2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$.

\soln Note that a matrix is nonhyperbolic if the determinant is positive
and the trace is zero.

(d) \ans The equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is asymptotically stable for
$a < -2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$ and the equilibrium at
$(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is asymptotically stable for
$a > 2.1\left/\sqrt{2.2}\right.$.  Thus, there is no value of $a$ for which
both equilibria are stable.  The equilibrium at $(0,0)$ is not stable,
since the eigenvalues of the Jacobian have opposite sign.

\soln Note that the determinant of the Jacobian is always positive, so
the equilibria are stable for values of $a$ at which the trace is negative.

(e) For $a = -2.1/\sqrt{2.2}$, the equilibrium at $(\sqrt{2.2},0)$
is non-hyperbolic, with Jacobian matrix
\[
(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)} = \mattwo{0}{1}{-4.4}{0}.
\]
The linear system $\dot{X} = (dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)}X$ is pictured in
Figure~\ref{c8.2.7}.  Note that the system is a center.  For
$a = 2.1/\sqrt{2.2}$, the equilibrium at $(-\sqrt{2.2},0)$ is
nonhyperbolic.  Its Jacobian at this point is identical to
$(dJ)_{(\sqrt{2.2},0)}$.

\begin{figure}[htb]
                       \centerline{%
                       \psfig{file=exfigure/8-2-7.eps,width=3.0in}}
                \exercap{c8.2.7}
\end{figure}

\exer{c8.2.8}
\ans There are two equilibria: a spiral source at $(0,0)$, and a saddle
at $(1,2)$.

\soln Solve the system for $\dot{x} = \dot{y} = 0$.  Then, compute the
Jacobian matrices at the equilibria, in this case
\[
(dJ)_{(0,0)} = \mattwo{2}{-1}{11}{0} \qquad
(dJ)_{(1,2)} = \mattwo{2}{-1}{13}{-12}
\]
and compute the eigenvalues of these matrices.  The eigenvalues of the
Jacobian of $(0,0)$ are $1 \pm \sqrt{10}i$.  Since the eigenvalues
are complex with positive real part, the equilibrium is
a spiral source.  The determinant of the Jacobian of $(1,2)$ is
$-11 < 0$.  Thus the equilibrium is a saddle.

\exer{E:nonhyp}
(a) Find all equilibria by computing $x$ and $y$ for $\dot{x} =
\dot{y} = 0$.  Then, from the second equation, $x = -y^3$, so
substituting into the first equation yields
\[
0 = y^9 + 2y^5 + y = y(y^4 + 1)^2.
\]
The only solution to this equation over the complex number system is
$y = 0$.  Therefore, the origin is the only equilibrium of
\Ref{e:nonhypcenter}.  The Jacobian matrix of \Ref{e:nonhypcenter} at
the origin is 
\[
(dJ)_{(0,0)} = \mattwo{0}{1}{-1}{0}.
\]
The eigenvalues of this Jacobian are $\pm i$.  Therefore, the equilibrium
is a center.

(b) First, compute $\dot{r}$:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(r) = \frac{d}{dt}(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) =
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\left(\frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)\right)
= \frac{1}{r}(x\dot{x} + y\dot{y}).
\]
Then, substitute \Ref{e:nonhypcenter} to obtain
\[
\dot{r} = \frac{1}{r}(x(y - x^3 - 2xy^2) + y(-x - y^3))
= -\frac{1}{r}(x^2 + y^2)^2 = -r^3.
\]
Note that $r''(t) = -3r(t)^2 < 0$.  Thus, $r = 0$ is a stable equilibrium
of \Ref{e:nonhypcenter}.

\exer{c8.2.10}
System \Ref{e:nonhypcenter} is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.2.10}a with four
trajectories.  Figure~\ref{c8.2.10}b shows the system in a small
neighborhood of the origin.  In this graph, trajectories appear to be
closed orbits.  Using the {\tt find an equilibrium} command, we find
that \Matlab considers the origin to be a spiral.

\end{figure}

\exer{c8.2.11}
(a) The {\tt pplane5} command {\tt find an equilibrium} verifies this.

(b) {\tt pplane5} computes the eigenvectors as $v_1 = (0.4723,0.8814)$
(the eigenvector associated to $\lambda_1$) and $v_2 =
(0.9911,0.1328)$ (the eigenvector associated to $\lambda_2$).
Indeed, trajectories approach the origin in the direction of $v_2$.

\exer{c8.2.12}
By evaluation using {\tt pplane5}, the equilibria on the square
$-2 \leq x,y \leq 2$ are: a nodal source at $(0,0)$, a saddle point
at $(0.1041, 0.1513)$, a spiral source at $(0.2768,1.632)$, and a
spiral sink at $(1.286,-0.45)$.  Figure~\ref{c8.2.12} shows
equilibria and sample trajectories of the system.

and $b(r^2) = 1$.

\]
Using the gradient system of differential equations, observe that

$f_x(x(t_0),y(t_0))=0$ and $f_y(x(t_0),y(t_0))=0$.  That is, 
$\dot{h}(t_0)=0$ if and only if $(x(t_0),y(t_0))$ is an equilibrium for the
gradient system.

\noindent (c) It follows from (b) that $\dot{h}$ is nowhere zero on a
nonconstant solution and from (a) that $\dot{h}(t)>0$ on a nonconstant
solution.  Therefore, $h(t)$ is monotonic increasing along any nonconstant
solution.

\noindent (d)  If $(x(t),y(t)$ is a nonconstant periodic solution of the
gradient system with period $T>0$, then $h(t+T)=h(t)$ for all $t$.  Thus,
$h(t)$ is not monotonic along this solution, contradicting (c).  Therefore,
nonconstant periodic solutions of gradient systems cannot exist.  

\exer{c8.3.2}
Figure~\ref{c8.3.2} shows the {\tt pplane5} graph of \Ref{8.3.2eq}.
The system has a single equilibrium at the origin, so all limit cycles
must surround the origin.  We can verify visually that the system has
one limit cycle at $r = 1$.  The graph of this system is similar to
the graph of \Ref{e:nonlincenter2}, since both
have single equilibria at the origin and single stable limit cycles at
$r = 1$.

\exer{c8.4.1}
Graph the system using {\tt pplane5}.  Then, find a saddle point at
$(-0.7426,-0.4902)$.  Plot the unstable and stable orbits.  The unstable
orbits and one stable orbit leave the graph window.  The other stable
orbit limits on a periodic solution around another equilibrium, the
spiral sink at $(-1.298,-3.209)$.  These are the only equilibria of
the system in this region.  The phase portrait is shown in
Figure~\ref{c8.4.1}.

There are two limit cycles: one surrounding the spiral source at
$(1.4650, 1.3590)$ and one surrounding the spiral sink at $(-1.3651, -1.4635)$.

(a) A graph of the system is shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.3}a.

(b) The four equilibria surround a roughly rectangular region.  As shown
by the connecting trajectories in the graph, all trajectories with
initial points inside this region remain in this region.  Note that this
includes trajectories with initial conditions inside the limit cycles.
All trajectories outside this region leave the window
$-3 \leq x,y \leq 3$ in forward or backward time.

shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.3}b.

\exer{c8.4.4}  See the figure for Exercise~\ref{c8.3.3} in
Section~\ref{S:periodic}.

\exer{c8.4.5a}
\ans There are five equilibria and two limit cycles.  The phase portrait is
given in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5a}a.  The orbits that stay bounded in
forward time are indicated in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5a}b.

\soln (a)  Using {\sf pplane5} we can find five equilibria
\begin{verbatim}
(0.0000, 0.0000)        Spiral source.           
(1.8519, 1.2300)        Nodal source.            
(0.3445, 0.0485)        Saddle point.            
(0.3102, -0.1118)       Spiral sink.             
(0.0000, -0.3333)       Saddle point.            
\end{verbatim}
We can show that there are at most five equilibria by solving:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0.04x - y - 3y^2 + 2.5xy & = & 0\\
x - 3x^2 + 2x^2y & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray*}  
Factoring the second equation leads to 
\[
x=0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad x = \frac{1}{3-2y}.
\]
Substituting $x=0$ into the first equation leads to the equilibria
$(0,0)$ and $(0,-\frac{1}{3})$. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{3-2y}$ into the
first equation yields
\[
\frac{0.04+2.5y}{3-2y} -(y+3y^2)=0.
\]
Multiplying this equation by $3-2y$ leads to a cubic equation that has at most
three roots.  Thus there are at most five equilibria in this system of
differential equations.

\noindent (b) There is numerical evidence for two limit cycles
one surrounding the spiral source at the origin and one surrounding the
spiral sink at $(0.3102, -0.1118)$.

\noindent (c)  The five equilibria, two limit cycles, and the stable and
unstable orbits of saddles are shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5a}a.

\noindent (d)  The solutions that stay bounded in forward time include the
equilibria, limit cycle and those indicated in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5a}b.

\exer{c8.4.5b}
\ans There are five equilibria and one limit cycle.  The phase portrait is
given in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5b}a.  The orbits that stay bounded in forward time
are indicated in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5b}b.

\soln  (a)  Using {\sf pplane5} we can find five equilibria
\begin{verbatim}
(0.0000, 0.0000)        Spiral source.           
(4.6347, 2.7842)        Nodal source.            
(0.3377, 0.0384)        Saddle point.            
(0.3169, -0.1560)       Spiral sink.             
(0.0000, -0.3333)       Saddle point.            
\end{verbatim}
We can show that there are at most five equilibria by solving:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0.05x - y - 3y^2 + 2xy & = & 0\\
x - 3x^2 + x^2y & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray*}  
Factoring the second equation leads to 
\[
x=0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad x = \frac{1}{3-y}.
\]
Substituting $x=0$ into the first equation leads to the equilibria
$(0,0)$ and $(0,-\frac{1}{3})$. Substituting $x = \frac{1}{3-y}$ into the
first equation yields
\[
\frac{0.05+2y}{3-y} -(y+3y^2)=0.
\]
Multiplying this equation by $3-y$ leads to a cubic equation that has at most
three roots.  Thus there are at most five equilibria in this system of
differential equations.

\noindent (b) There is numerical evidence for just one limit cycle
surrounding the equilibrium at the origin.

\noindent (c)  The five equilibria, one limit cycle, and the stable and
unstable orbits of saddles are shown in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5b}a.

\noindent (d)  The solutions that stay bounded in forward time include the
equilibria, limit cycle and those indicated in Figure~\ref{c8.4.5b}b.
