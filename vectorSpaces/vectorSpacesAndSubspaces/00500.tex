\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c5.1.4a} -- \ref{c5.1.4f} you are given a
vector space $V$ and a subset $W$.  For each pair, decide whether or
not $W$ is a subspace of $V$, and explain why.
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4a}
$V=\R^3$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^3$
     that have a $0$ in their first component.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4b}
$V=\R^3$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^3$
     that have a $1$ in their first component.

\begin{solution}
\ans $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.

\soln The subset $W$ is closed neither under addition nor under scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $w_1 = (1,4,2)$ and $w_2 = (1,-1,3)$
be elements of $W$.  Then,
\[
w_1 + w_2 = (1,4,2) + (1,-1,3) = (2,3,5)
\]
which is not an element of $W$.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4d}
$V=\R^2$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^2$
     for which the sum of the components is $1$.

\begin{solution}
\ans $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.

\soln The subset $W$ is closed neither under addition nor under scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $w_1 = (3,-2)$ and $w_2 = (0,1)$ be
elements of $W$.  Then,
\[
w_1 + w_2 = (3,-2) + (0,1) = (3,-3).
\]
The sum of the elements $3 - 3 = 0 \neq 1$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4c}
$V=\R^2$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^2$
     for which the sum of the components is $0$.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4g}
$V=\CCone$ and $W$ consists of functions
     $x(t)\in\CCone$ satisfying $\int_{-2}^4x(t)dt =0$.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4e}
$V=\CCone$ and $W$ consists of functions
     $x(t)\in\CCone$ satisfying $x(1)=0$.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4f}
$V=\CCone$ and $W$ consists of functions
     $x(t)\in\CCone$ satisfying $x(1)=1$.

\begin{solution}
\ans $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.

\soln The subset $W$ is closed neither under addition nor under scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $w_1(t) = t$ and let $w_2(t) = t^2$.
\[
(w_1 + w_2)(1) = w_1(1) + w_2(1) = 1 + 1 = 2,
\]
so $(w_1 + w_2)(t)$ is not an element of $W$.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
