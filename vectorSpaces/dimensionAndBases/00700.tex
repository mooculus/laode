Let ${\cal P}_3$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree at
most three in one variable $t$.  Let $p(t)=t^3+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0$ where
$a_0,a_1,a_2\in\R$ are fixed constants.  Show that
\[
\left\{ p, \frac{dp}{dt}, \frac{d^2p}{dt^2}, \frac{d^3p}{dt^3}\right\}
\]
is a basis for ${\cal P}_3$.

\begin{solution}

\soln
First, note that the dimension of ${\cal P}_3$ is $4$.  We can show
this by noting that the $4$ polynomials $b_1(t) = t^3$, $b_2(t) =
t^2$, $b_3(t) = t$, and $b_4(t) = 1$ are linearly independent and
span ${\cal P}_3$.  The dimension of a space is equal to the number of
linearly independent vectors in a spanning set for that space.
Therefore, $\{p, \frac{dp}{dt}, \frac{d^2p}{dt^2}, \frac{d^3p}{dt^3}\}$
is a basis if the polynomials are linearly independent.

\para The general polynomial of degree $3$ has the form $q(t) =
a_3t^3 + a_2t^2 + a_1t + a_0$.  We can identify $q(t)$ by the vector 
$(a_3,a_2,a_1,a_0)$.  Thus, the set
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dps p(t) & = & t^3 + a_2t^2 + a_1t + a_0 \\
\dps \frac{dp}{dt}(t) & = & 3t^2 + 2a_2t + a_1 \\
\dps \frac{d^2p}{dt^2}(t) & = & 6t + 2a_2 \\
\dps \frac{d^3p}{dt^3}(t) & = & 6 \end{array}
\]
is identified with the matrix $A$, whose columns are 
$\frac{dp}{dt}$, $\frac{d^2p}{dt^2}$, and $\frac{d^3p}{dt^3}$:
\[ A = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
a_2 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\ a_1 & 2a_2 & 6 & 0 \\ a_0 & a_1 & 2a_2 & 6
\end{array}\right). \]
The matrix is lower triangular and therefore row reduces to $I_4$.  So
this set of polynomials is linearly independent and spans ${\cal P}_3$.
