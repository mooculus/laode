The minimum number of vectors that span a vector space has special
significance.

\begin{definition}
The vector space $V$ has {\em finite dimension\/} if $V$ is the
span of a finite number of vectors.  If $V$ has finite dimension, then the
smallest number of vectors that span $V$ is called the {\em dimension\/} of
$V$ and is denoted by $\dim V$.
\end{definition} \index{dimension}\index{dimension!finite} \index{span}

For example, recall that $e_j$ is the vector in $\R^n$ whose $j^{th}$
component is $1$ and all of whose other components are $0$.
Let $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ be in $\R^n$. Then
\begin{equation}  \label{e:spanrn}
x =  x_1e_1 + \cdots + x_ne_n.
\end{equation}
Since every vector in $\R^n$ is a linear combination of the
vectors $e_1,\ldots,e_n$, it follows that
$\R^n=\Span\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$.  Thus, $\R^n$ is finite
dimensional.  Moreover, the dimension of $\R^n$ is at most $n$,
since $\R^n$ is spanned by $n$ vectors. It seems unlikely that
$\R^n$ could be spanned by fewer than $n$ vectors--- but this
point needs to be proved.

\subsubsection*{An Example of a Vector Space that is Not Finite Dimensional}
\index{dimension!infinite}

Next we discuss an example of a vector space that does not have finite 
dimension.  Consider the subspace ${\cal P}\subset\CCone$ consisting of 
polynomials \index{subspace!of polynomials} of all degrees.  We show that 
${\cal P}$ is not the span of a finite number of vectors and hence that 
${\cal P}$ does not have finite dimension.  Let $p_1(t),p_2(t),\ldots,p_k(t)$ 
be a set of $k$ polynomials and let $d$ be the maximum degree of these $k$ 
polynomials.  Then every polynomial in the span of $p_1(t),\ldots,p_k(t)$ has 
degree less than or equal to $d$.  In particular, $p(t)=t^{d+1}$ is a 
polynomial that is not in the span of $p_1(t),\ldots,p_k(t)$ and ${\cal P}$ 
is not spanned by finitely many vectors.


\subsection*{Bases and The Main Theorem}

\begin{definition} \label{basis}
Let ${\cal B} = \{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}$ be a set of vectors in a
vector space $W$.  The subset ${\cal B}$ is a {\em basis\/} for $W$
if ${\cal B}$ is a spanning set for $W$ with the smallest number
of elements in a spanning set for $W$.
\end{definition} \index{basis} \index{spanning set}

It follows that if $\{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}$ is a basis for $W$, then
$k=\dim W$. The main theorem about bases is:

\begin{theorem}  \label{basis=span+indep}
A set of vectors ${\cal B} =\{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}$ in a vector space $W$
is a basis for $W$ if and only if the set ${\cal B}$ is linearly
independent and spans $W$.
\end{theorem} \index{linearly!independent} \index{basis} \index{span}

\noindent {\bf Remark:}  The importance of Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep} is
that we can show that a set of vectors is a basis by verifying spanning
and linear independence.   We never have to check directly that the spanning
set has the minimum number of vectors for a spanning set.


For example, we have shown previously that the set of vectors
$\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ in $\R^n$ is linearly independent and spans $\R^n$.  It
follows from Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep} that this set is a basis,
and that the dimension of $\R^n$ is $n$\index{dimension!of $\R^n$}.
In particular, $\R^n$ cannot be spanned by fewer than $n$ vectors.

The proof of Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep} is given in Section~\ref{S:5.6}.


\subsection*{Consequences of Theorem~\protect\ref{basis=span+indep}}

We discuss two applications of Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep}.  First,
we use this theorem to derive a way of determining the dimension of the
subspace spanned by a finite number of vectors.  Second, we show that the
dimension of the subspace of solutions to a homogeneous system of linear
equation $Ax=0$ is $n-\rank(A)$ where $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix.

\subsubsection*{Computing the Dimension of a Span} \index{dimension}

We show that the dimension of a span of vectors can be found using
elementary row operations on $M$. \index{elementary row operations}

\begin{lemma}  \label{L:computerank}
Let $w_1,\ldots,w_k$ be $k$ row vectors in $\R^n$ and let
$W=\Span\{w_1,\ldots,w_k\}\subset\R^n$.  Define
\[
M =\left(\begin{array}{c} w_1\\ \vdots \\w_k \end{array}\right)
\]
to be the matrix whose rows are the $w_j$s.  Then
\begin{equation}  \label{e:dimW=rankM}
\dim(W) = \rank(M).
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}\index{dimension}\index{rank}

\begin{proof} To verify \eqref{e:dimW=rankM}, observe that the span of
$w_1,\ldots,w_k$ is unchanged by
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] swapping $w_i$ and $w_j$,
\item[(b)] multiplying $w_i$ by a nonzero scalar, and
\item[(c)] adding a multiple of $w_i$ to $w_j$.
\end{itemize}
That is, if we perform elementary row operations on $M$, the
vector space spanned by the rows of $M$ does not change. So we
may perform elementary row operations on $M$ until we arrive at
the matrix $E$ in reduced echelon form.  \index{echelon form!reduced} 
Suppose that $\ell=\rank(M)$; that is, suppose that $\ell$
is the number of nonzero rows in $E$.  Then
\[
E =\left(\begin{array}{c} v_1\\ \vdots \\v_\ell\\ 0 \\ \vdots
\\ 0 \end{array}\right),
\]
where the $v_j$ are the nonzero rows in the reduced echelon form
matrix.

We claim that the vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_\ell$ are linearly
independent.  It then follows from Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep} that
$\{v_1,\ldots,v_\ell\}$ is a basis for $W$ and that the dimension of
$W$ is $\ell$.  To verify the claim, suppose
\begin{equation} \label{e:rowsums}
a_1v_1 + \cdots + a_\ell v_\ell = 0.
\end{equation}
We show that $a_i$ must equal $0$ as follows.  In the $i^{th}$
row, the pivot\index{pivot} must occur in some column --- say in the $j^{th}$
column.  It follows that the $j^{th}$ entry in the vector of the
left hand side of \eqref{e:rowsums} is
\[
0a_1 + \cdots + 0a_{i-1} +1a_i + 0a_{i+1} + \cdots + 0a_\ell =
a_i,
\]
since all entries in the $j^{th}$ column of $E$ other than the
pivot must be zero, as $E$ is in reduced echelon form.  \end{proof}

For instance, let $W=\Span\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ in $\R^4$ where
\begin{matlabEquation} \label{eq:vectors}
  \begin{array}{ccl}
    w_1 &=& (3, -2, 1,-1), \\
    w_2 &=& (1,5,10,12), \\
    w_3 &=& (1,-12,-19,-25).
  \end{array}
\end{matlabEquation}%
To compute $\dim W$ in \Matlab, type \verb+e5_5_4+ to load the
vectors and type
\begin{verbatim}
M = [w1; w2; w3]
\end{verbatim}
Row reduction\index{row!reduction} of the matrix {\tt M} in \Matlab
leads to the reduced echelon form matrix
\begin{verbatim}
ans =
     1.0000         0    1.4706    1.1176
         0     1.0000    1.7059    2.1765
         0          0         0         0
\end{verbatim}
indicating that the dimension of the subspace $W$ is two, and
therefore $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ is not a basis of $W$. Alternatively,
we can use the \Matlab command {\tt rank(M)}\index{\computer!rank}
to compute the rank of $M$ and the dimension of the span $W$.

However, if we change one of the entries in $w_3$, for instance
{\tt w3(3)=-18} then indeed the command {\tt rank([w1;w2;w3])}
gives the answer three indicating that for this choice of vectors
$\{w1,w2,w3\}$ is a basis for $\Span\{w1,w2,w3\}$.

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Homogeneous Systems Revisited}
\index{homogeneous}

We return to our discussions in Chapter~\ref{lineq} on solving
linear equations.  Recall that we can write all solutions to
the system of homogeneous equations $Ax=0$ in terms of a few
parameters, and that the null space of $A$ is the subspace of
solutions (See Definition~\ref{D:nullspace}).
More precisely, Proposition~\ref{P:n-rank} states that the number of
parameters needed is $n-\rank(A)$ where $n$ is the number of
variables in the homogeneous system.  We claim that the dimension
of the null space\index{dimension!of null space} is exactly
$n - \rank(A)$.

For example, consider the reduced echelon form $3\times 7$ matrix
\begin{equation}  \label{E:nullityexamp}
A=\left(\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}
1 & -4 & 0 &  2 & -3 & 0 & 8 \\
0 &  0 & 1 &  3 &  2 & 0 & 4 \\
0 &  0 & 0 &  0 &  0 & 1 & 2  \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
that has rank three. Suppose that the unknowns for this system of
equations are
$x_1,\ldots,x_7$.  We can solve the equations associated with
$A$ by solving the first equation for $x_1$, the second equation
for $x_3$, and the third equation for $x_6$, as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_1 & = & 4x_2 - 2x_4 + 3x_5 - 8x_7 \\
x_3 & = &      - 3x_4 - 2x_5 - 4x_7 \\
x_6 & = &                    - 2x_7
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, all solutions to this system of equations have the form
\begin{equation}   \label{e:expandsoln}
\left(\begin{array}{c} 4x_2 - 2x_4 + 3x_5 - 8x_7 \\ x_2 \\
        -3x_4 - 2x_5 - 4x_7 \\ x_4 \\ x_5 \\  - 2x_7 \\ x_7 \end{array} \right)\end{equation}
  which equals
\begin{equation*}
x_2 \left(\begin{array}{r}  4 \\ 1 \\  0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\  0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right) +
x_4 \left(\begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 0 \\ -3 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\  0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right) +
x_5 \left(\begin{array}{r}  3 \\ 0 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\  0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right) +
x_7 \left(\begin{array}{r} -8 \\ 0 \\ -4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ -2 \\ 1
\end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
\noindent We can rewrite the right hand side of \eqref{e:expandsoln}
as a linear combination\index{linear!combination} of four
vectors $w_2,w_4,w_5,w_7$
\begin{equation}   \label{e:w'scomb}
x_2w_2 + x_4w_4 + x_5w_5 + x_7w_7.
\end{equation}

This calculation shows that the null space of $A$, which is
$W=\{x\in\R^7:Ax=0\}$, is spanned by the four vectors
$w_2,w_4,w_5,w_7$.  Moreover, this same calculation shows that
the four vectors  are linearly independent.
From the left hand side of \eqref{e:expandsoln} we see that if this
linear combination sums to zero, then $x_2=x_4=x_5=x_7=0$.  It
follows from Theorem~\ref{basis=span+indep} that $\dim W = 4$.

\begin{definition}  \label{D:nullity}
The {\em nullity\/} of $A$ is the dimension of the null space of $A$.
\end{definition} \index{nullity}\index{null space!dimension}

\begin{theorem}  \label{T:dimsoln}
Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Then
\[
{\rm nullity}(A) + \rank(A) = n.
\]
\end{theorem} \index{rank}

\begin{proof}	Neither the rank nor the null space of $A$ are changed by
elementary row operations.  So we can assume that $A$ is in reduced
echelon form.  The rank of $A$ is the number of nonzero rows in
the reduced echelon form matrix.  Proposition~\ref{P:n-rank} states that
the null space is spanned by $p$ vectors where $p=n-\rank(A)$.  We
must show that these vectors are linearly independent.

Let $j_1,\ldots,j_p$ be the columns of $A$ that do not contain pivots.
In example \eqref{E:nullityexamp} $p=4$ and
\[
j_1 = 2, \qquad j_2 = 4, \qquad j_3 = 5, \qquad j_4 = 7.
\]
After solving for the variables corresponding to pivots, we find that
the spanning set of the null space consists of $p$ vectors in $\R^n$,
which we label as $\{w_{j_1},\ldots,w_{j_p}\}$.  See \eqref{e:expandsoln}.
Note that the $j_m$$^{th}$  entry of $w_{j_m}$ is $1$ while the
$j_m$$^{th}$ entry in all of the other $p-1$ vectors is $0$.  Again,
see \eqref{e:expandsoln} as an example that supports this statement.  It
follows that the set of spanning vectors is a linearly independent set.
That is, suppose that
\[
r_1w_{j_1} + \cdots + r_pw_{j_p} = 0.
\]
From the $j_m$$^{th}$ entry in this equation, it follows that $r_m=0$;
and the vectors are linearly independent.  \end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{T:dimsoln} has an interesting and useful interpretation.
We have seen in the previous subsection that the rank of a matrix $A$
is just the number of linearly independent rows in $A$.
In linear systems each row of the coefficient matrix corresponds
to a linear equation.  Thus, the rank of $A$ may be thought of as the
number of independent equations in a system of linear equations.
This theorem just states that the space of solutions loses a dimension
for each independent equation.
