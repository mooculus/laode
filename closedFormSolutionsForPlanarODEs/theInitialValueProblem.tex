\label{S:6.1}

Recall that a planar autonomous \index{autonomous} system of
ordinary differential equations has the form
\arraystart
\begin{equation}  \label{2dsystem}
\begin{array}{ccl}
\dps \frac{dx}{dt}  & = & f(x,y) \\
\dps \frac{dy}{dt}  & = & g(x,y).
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\arrayfinish
Computer experiments using {\sf pplane5} always appear to find a unique
solution to initial value problems.  More precisely, we are led to
believe that there is just one solution to \Ref{2dsystem} satisfying
the initial conditions\index{initial condition}
\begin{eqnarray*}
x(0) & = & x_0 \\
y(0) & = & y_0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection*{Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions}

In fact, existence \index{existence of solutions} and uniqueness
of solutions \index{uniqueness of solutions} are not always guaranteed
--- though they are guaranteed for a large class of differential
equations, as the following theorem shows.

\begin{thm}  \label{exist&unique}
Suppose that the functions $f$ and $g$ in the system of
differential equations \Ref{2dsystem} are differentiable near
$(x_0,y_0)$ and that the partial derivatives $f_x,f_y,g_x,g_y$
are continuous near $(x_0,y_0)$.  Then there exists a unique
solution to \Ref{2dsystem} with initial conditions
$(x(0),y(0))=(x_0,y_0)$.
\end{thm} \index{uniqueness of solutions}

For example, consider the planar system of constant coefficient linear
differential equations:
\arraystart
\begin{equation}  \label{2dlinsystem}
\begin{array}{ccl}
\dps \frac{dx}{dt}  & = & ax+by \\
\dps \frac{dy}{dt}  & = & cx+dy.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\arrayfinish
In \Ref{2dlinsystem}, $f(x,y)=ax+by$ and $g(x,y)=cx+dy$.  The partial
derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are easy to calculate; they are: $f_x=a$, $f_y=b$,
$g_x=c$, and $g_y=d$.  As constant functions, all of these partial
derivatives are continuous.  Hence, existence and uniqueness of solutions to
the initial value problem for \Ref{2dlinsystem} are guaranteed by
Theorem~\ref{exist&unique}.


Although we have stated this theorem just for planar systems, the theorem
itself is valid in all dimensions.   For example, in one dimension the analog
of Theorem~\ref{exist&unique} states that the differential equation
\[
\dot{x} = f(x)
\]
with initial condition
\[
x(0)=x_0
\]
has a unique solution $x(t)$ when $f'(x)$ exists and is
continuous near $x_0$.

A discussion of the proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text;
nevertheless, the theorem is valid and we will use its consequences.

\subsubsection*{An Example of Nonuniqueness of Solutions}
\index{nonuniqueness of solutions}

Indeed, uniqueness of solutions is not even
guaranteed for single equations.  Here is an example:
\begin{equation}  \label{nonunique}
\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\sqrt[3]{x^2} = 3x^{2/3}
\end{equation}
with the initial condition
\[
x(0)=0.
\]
Certainly the constant function $x(t)=0$ is a solution to \Ref{nonunique}
satisfying the initial value $x(0)=0$.  In addition, the function
\[
x(t) = t^3
\]
is a solution to \Ref{nonunique}.  This fact is checked by direct
calculation:
\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2 \AND  3x^{2/3}= 3(t^3)^{2/3} = 3t^2.
\]

Example \Ref{nonunique} shows that hypotheses like those in
Theorem~\ref{exist&unique} are needed.  Indeed, in \Ref{nonunique}
\[
f(x)=3x^{2/3} \AND f'(x) = \frac{2}{x^{1/3}}.
\]
Hence, $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ and the hypotheses of
Theorem~\ref{exist&unique} fail.

At this point it is worth looking to see what {\sf dfield5}
computes numerically.  Start {\sf dfield5} \index{\computer!dfield5} and
change the differential equation to:
\begin{verbatim}
x' = (x^2)^(1/3)
\end{verbatim}
Writing the differential equation in this way guarantees that
the computer will not compute square roots of negative numbers.
Click on the {\sf Proceed} button.  In the {\sf DFIELD5 Display}
window attempt to click on the origin --- that is, attempt to
enter the initial condition $x(0)=0$ using the mouse.  You will surely get
a solution that has a similar shape to the graph of the cubic function
$x=t^3$.  In the {\sf DFIELD5 Options} menu click on {\sf Keyboard input},
and in the {\sf DFIELD5 Keyboard input} window enter the
values $t=0$ and $x=0$.  After clicking on the {\sf Compute}
button you will see the solution $x=0$.  Now click on the {\sf
Erase all solutions} button in the {\sf DFIELD5 Options} menu.
Change the initial value of $x$ to $0.00001$ in the {\sf DFIELD5
Keyboard input} window and click on {\sf Compute}.  You will see
a solution that looks like $x=t^3$.  See Figure~\ref{nonuniquefig}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
        \centerline{%
        \psfig{file=figures/nonuniqa.eps,width=3.2in}
	\psfig{file=figures/nonuniqb.eps,width=3.2in}}
        \caption{Solutions for \protect\Ref{nonunique}
              for $t\in [-3,3]$ and $x\in [-4,4]$. Left: $x(0)=0$.
	      Right: $x(0)=0.00001$.}

At this stage, we do not have the background to discuss the numerical
method employed by {\sf dfield5}.

\subsection*{The Initial Value Problem for Linear Systems}
\index{initial value problem}

In this chapter we discuss how to find solutions $(x(t),y(t))$ to
\Ref{2dlinsystem} satisfying the initial values $x(0)=x_0$ and $y(0)=y_0$.
It is convenient to rewrite \Ref{2dlinsystem} in matrix form as:
\begin{equation} \label{ndlinsystem}
\frac{dX}{dt}(t) = CX(t).
\end{equation}
The initial value problem is then stated as:  Find a solution to
\Ref{ndlinsystem} satisfying $X(0)=X_0$ where $X_0=(x_0,y_0)^t$.
Everything that we have said here works equally well for $n$
dimensional systems of linear differential equations.  Just let
$C$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let $X_0$ be an $n$ vector
of initial conditions.

\subsubsection*{Solving the Initial Value Problem Using Superposition}

In Section~\ref{S:IVPR} we discussed how to solve~\Ref{ndlinsystem} when the
eigenvalues of $C$ are real and distinct.  Recall that when $\lambda_1$ and
$\lambda_2$ are distinct real eigenvalues of $C$ with associated
eigenvectors $v_1$ and $v_2$, there are two solutions to \Ref{ndlinsystem}
given by the explicit formulas
\[
X_1(t) = e^{\lambda_1 t}v_1 \AND X_2(t) = e^{\lambda_2 t}v_2.
\]
Superposition guarantees that every linear combination of these solutions
\[
X(t) = \alpha_1X_1(t)+\alpha_2X_2(t) =
\alpha_1e^{\lambda_1 t}v_1 + \alpha_2e^{\lambda_2 t}v_2
\]
is a solution to \Ref{ndlinsystem}.  In addition, we can always choose
scalars $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in\R$ to solve any given initial value problem
of \Ref{ndlinsystem}.   It follows from the uniqueness of solutions to
initial value problems stated in Theorem~\ref{exist&unique} that all
solutions to \Ref{ndlinsystem} are included in this family of solutions.

We generalize this discussion so that we will be able to find closed form 
solutions to \Ref{ndlinsystem} in Section~\ref{S:TDM} when the eigenvalues 
of $C$ are complex or are real and equal.

Suppose that $X_1(t)$ and $X_2(t)$ are two solutions to \Ref{2dlinsystem} such
that
\[
v_1=X_1(0) \AND v_2=X_2(0)
\]
are linearly independent\index{linearly!independent}.  The existence part of
Theorem~\ref{exist&unique}
guarantees that such solutions exist.  Then all solutions to \Ref{2dlinsystem}
are linear combinations of these two solutions.  We verify this statement as
follows.  Corollary~\ref{C:dim=n} of Chapter~\ref{C:vectorspaces} states
that since $\{v_1,v_2\}$ is a linearly independent set in $\R^2$, it is
also a basis of $\R^2$.  Thus for every $X_0\in\R^2$ there exist scalars
$r_1,r_2$ such that
\[
X_0 = r_1v_1 + r_2v_2.
\]
It follows from superposition and Theorem~\ref{exist&unique} that the
solution
\[
X(t) = r_1X_1(t) + r_2X_2(t)
\]
is the unique solution whose initial condition vector is $X_0$.

We have proved that every solution to this linear system of differential
equations is a linear combination of these two solutions --- that is, we
have proved that the dimension of the space of solutions to \Ref{ndlinsystem}
is two.  This proof generalizes immediately to a proof of the following
theorem for $n\times n$ systems.

\begin{thm}  \label{T:solvends}
Let $C$ be an $n\times n$ matrix.  Suppose that $X_1(t),\ldots,X_n(t)$
are  solutions to $\dot{X}=CX$ such that the vectors of initial conditions
$v_j=X_j(0)$ are linearly independent in $\R^n$.  Then the unique solution
to the system \Ref{ndlinsystem} with initial condition $X(0)=X_0$ is
\begin{equation}  \label{E:genlsoln}
X(t)=r_1X_1(t) + \cdots + r_nX_n(t),
\end{equation}
where $r_1,\ldots,r_n$ are scalars satisfying
\begin{equation} \label{findscalars}
X_0 = r_1v_1 + \cdots + r_nv_n.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}\index{initial condition!linear independence}

We call \Ref{E:genlsoln} the {\em general solution\/} \index{general solution}
to the system of differential equations $\dot{X}=CX$.  When solving the
initial value problem we find a {\em particular solution\/}\index{particular
solution}
by specifying the scalars $r_1,\ldots,r_n$.

\begin{cor}  \label{C:indsoln}
Let $C$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let ${\cal X}=\{X_1(t),\ldots,X_n(t)\}$
be solutions to the differential equation $\dot{X}=CX$ such that the vectors
$X_j(0)$ are linearly independent in $\R^n$.  Then the set of all solutions
to $\dot{X}=CX$ is an $n$-dimensional subspace of $(\CCone)^n$, and
${\cal X}$ is a basis for the solution subspace.
\end{cor}\index{subspace!of solutions}

Consider a special case of Theorem~\ref{T:solvends}.  Suppose that the
matrix $C$ has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ with
real eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$.  Then the functions
$X_j(t)=e^{\lambda_j t}v_j$ are solutions to $\dot{X}=CX$.
Corollary~\ref{C:indsoln} implies that the functions $X_j$ form a basis for
the space of solutions of this system of differential equations.  Indeed,
the general solution to \Ref{ndlinsystem} is
\begin{equation}  \label{e:gensoln}
X(t) = r_1e^{\lambda_1 t}v_1 + \cdots + r_ne^{\lambda_n t}v_n.
\end{equation}
The particular solution that solves the initial value $X(0)=X_0$ is found by
solving \Ref{findscalars} for the scalars $r_1,\ldots,r_n$.
