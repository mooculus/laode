\begin{computerExercise} \label{c6.3.3}
Use {\pplane} to plot phase plane portraits for each of the
three types of linear systems (a), (b) and (c) in Table~\ref{T:3sys}.
Based on this computer exploration answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]  If a solution to that system spirals about the origin,
is the system of differential equations of type (a), (b) or (c)?
\item[(ii)]  How many eigendirections are there for equations of type (c)?
\item[(iii)]  Let $(x(t),y(t))$ be a solution to one of these three types of
systems and suppose that $y(t)$ oscillates up and down infinitely often.
Then $(x(t),y(t))$ is a solution for which type of system?
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
Figure~\ref{c6.3.3}a shows the graph of the system
\[ 
\begin{array}{rrr}
\dot{x} & = & \lambda x \\ 
\dot{y} & = & \mu y \end{array} 
\]
where $\lambda = 2$ and $\mu = -3$.

\para Figure~\ref{c6.3.3}b shows the graph of the system
\[ 
\begin{array}{rrr}
\dot{x} & = & \sigma x - \tau y \\
\dot{y} & = & \tau x + \sigma y \end{array} 
\]
where $\sigma = 2$ and $\tau = 3$.

\para Figure~\ref{c6.3.3}c shows the graph of the system
\[ 
\begin{array}{rrr}
\dot{x} & = & \lambda x + y \\
\dot{y} & = & \lambda y \end{array} 
\]
where $\lambda = 2$.

(a) The system is of type (b) if a solution spirals about the origin.

(b) Equations of type (c) have one eigendirection.

(c) If $y(t)$ oscillates up and down infinitely often, then
$(x(t),y(t))$ is a solution to a system of type (b).
